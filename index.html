ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021

                    <span>I joined Grafana Labs last year as a software engineer in the Enterprise Plugins team and then moved to the Cloud Data Sources team as an engineering manager this year.
When our first company-wide hackathon was announced in June, I decided to participate for a few reasons. After moving to the manager track, I thought it was a great opportunity to do some coding between meetings. Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative. And finally, I wanted to set an example for my team. When it comes to personal development or finding personal projects, I regularly encourage the team to take a break from Business As Usual (BAU)…</span>

                    <span>The name Debian brings to mind a Linux
distribution, but the Debian project is far more than that; it is an
ongoing experiment in democratic project governance.  Debian&#x27;s processes
can result in a lot of public squabbling; one should not lose track,
though, of the fact that those processes have enabled a large community to
maintain and grow a complex distribution for decades without the benefit of
an overseeing corporate overlord.  Processes can be improved, though; a
recent proposal
from Russ Allbery gives an interesting picture of where the pain points
are and what can be made better.</span>

                    <span>Made public this week by CPU security researchers at Graz University of Technology and CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security was the research paper published &quot;AMD Prefetch Attacks through Power and Time&quot;. The paper points to AMD CPUs suffering from a side-channel leakage vulnerability through timing and power variations of the PREFETCH instruction. The paper argues that AMD CPUs should activate stronger page table isolation by default. AMD has now published their security response where they are not recommending any mitigation changes at this time. But what if Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI/PTI) proves necessary for AMD CPUs? Here are some initial benchmarks showing what that performance impact could look like.</span>

                    <span>The latest release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution is out: Ubuntu 21.10, code named &quot;Impish Indri&quot;.  The release notes fills in all of the details for the new features in this version, but the announcement lists some as well:


Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 makes wayland sessions available while using the 
Nvidia proprietary driver. PulseAudio 15 introduces support for Bluetooth
LDAC and AptX codecs, as well as HFP Bluetooth profiles providing better
audio quality. The recovery key feature at installation time has been
improved, with the recovery key now optional, stronger and editable.
Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 includes GNOME version 40, with a new and
improved Activities Overview design. Workspaces are now arranged
horizontally, and the overview and app grid are accessed vertically.
Each direction has accompanying keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures
and mouse actions.

Ubuntu Server 21.10 integrates recent innovations from key open
infrastructure projects like OpenStack Xena, QEMU 6.0, PHP8, libvirt 7.6,
Kubernetes, and Ceph with advanced life-cycle management tools for
multi-cloud and on-prem operations from bare metal, VMWare and
OpenStack, to every major public cloud.</span>

                    <span>Concerns over the performance of programs written in Python are often
overstated — for some use cases, at least.  But there is no getting around
the problem imposed by the infamous global interpreter lock (GIL), which
severely limits the concurrency of multi-threaded Python code.  Various
efforts to remove the GIL have been made
over the years, but none have come anywhere near the point where they would
be considered for inclusion into the CPython interpreter.  Now, though, Sam
Gross has entered
the arena with a proof-of-concept implementation that may solve the
problem for real.</span>

                    <span>The KDE project is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a special release
of the Plasma desktop.


	This time around, Plasma renews its looks and, not only do you get
	a new wallpaper, but also a gust of fresh air from an updated
	theme: Breeze - Blue Ocean. The new Breeze theme makes KDE apps and
	tools not only more attractive, but also easier to use both on the
	desktop and your phone and tablet.

	Of course, looks are not the only you can expect from Plasma 25AE:
	extra speed, increased reliability and new features have also found
	their way into the app launcher, the software manager, the Wayland
	implementation, and most other Plasma tools and utilities.


Lots of details can be found in the
changelog.</span>

                    <span>At GrafanaCONline in June, we talked about the future of machine learning at Grafana Labs. Four months later, we are excited to introduce Grafana Machine Learning for Grafana Cloud, with our metrics forecasting capability. It’s available now to all customers on Pro or Advanced plans. If you’re not already using Grafana Cloud, you can sign up for a free 14-day trial of Grafana Cloud Pro here.
In this blog post, we’ll go over some use cases and real-world examples for Grafana Machine Learning.
Using machine learning to solve real-world problems
Adaptive alerts
It’s hard to create useful alerts that stay useful over time. Static thresholds that made sense in the past no longer do. They can’t adapt to the context like expected busy or quiet periods.

                    <span>Production readiness review (PRR) is a process that originated at Google, described as the first step of site reliability engineering engagement in the company’s famous SRE book. The idea of thoroughly reviewing a product before handing over the pager is a really good one, but except for Google-scale companies, there aren’t that many organizations that can afford dedicated SRE teams.
At Grafana Labs, our product teams often take the role of the SRE teams. Moreover, due to a lot of technical similarities, we have an on-call rotation that’s responsible for multiple products — staffed with engineers from different product teams. Since there’s no official SRE onboarding, we’ve built production readiness review as a completely separate process that strives to add value by having the product in …</span>

                    <span>The syzbot
kernel-fuzzing system finds an enormous number of bugs, but, since many 
of them may seem to be of a relatively low severity, they have a lower priority
when contending for the attention of developers.  A talk
at the recent Linux 
Security Summit North America reported on some research that
dug further into the bugs that syzbot has
found; the results are rather worrisome.  Rather than a pile of
difficult- or impossible-to-exploit bugs, there are numerous, more serious
problems lurking within.</span>

some of the changes and new features arriving with the upcoming
version 1.7 release of the Julia programming language.
The package system provided by the language makes it easier to
explore new language versions, while still preserving 
multiple versions of various parts of the ecosystem.  This flexible system
takes care of dependency management, both 
for writing exploratory code in the REPL and for
developing projects or libraries.</span>

                    <span>Grafana 8.2 was released last week, and we’re excited to announce one of its new features: contact point testing. Now users of Grafana 8 alerting can test their contact points right from the contact points page. This feature makes it easier to configure Grafana 8 alerting and gives you the confidence in knowing that your contact points are working as expected before they fire.
Here are the basics:
What are contact points?
Contact points contain configuration for zero or more contact point types (i.e. email, Slack, webhook, etc.) that receive notifications when an alert is firing. A contact point is not limited to just one contact point type and can have multiple contact point types.

                    <span>There are many barriers to producing software that is reliable and
maintainable over the long term.  One of those is software complexity.  At
the recently concluded 2021 KVM
Forum, Paolo Bonzini
explored
this topic, using QEMU, the open source emulator
and virtualizer, as a case study.  Drawing on his experience as
a maintainer of several QEMU subsystems, he made some concrete
suggestions on how to defend against undesirable complexity.  Bonzini
used QEMU as a running example throughout the talk, hoping to make it
easier for future contributors to modify QEMU.  However, the
lessons he shared are equally applicable to many other projects.</span>

results of a study into the data collected by a number of Android
variants.  There are few surprises here, but the picture is still
discouraging.


	We find that the Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and Realme Android
	variants all transmit a substantial volume of data to the OS
	developer (i.e. Samsung etc) and to third-party parties that have
	pre-installed system apps (including Google, Microsoft, Heytap,
	LinkedIn, Facebook). LineageOS sends similar volumes of data to
	Google as these proprietary Android variants, but we do not observe
	the LineageOS developers themselves collecting data nor
	pre-installed system apps other than those of Google. Notably,
	/e/OS sends no information to Google or other third parties and

                    <span>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here&#x27;s Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.

                    <span>Today we are releasing Grafana 7.5.11 and 8.1.6. These patch releases include an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 2.0.1.
All Grafana Cloud instances have been protected since 2021-09-16, and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. Grafana Enterprise customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo on 2021-09-28.
8.1.5 contained a single fix for bar chart panels. We believe that users can expedite deployment by moving from 8.1.4 to 8.1.6 directly.

We know we have community members all over the globe, and we’re excited to be able to present these webinars at different times so that more people can participate in the live sessions and Q&amp;A.
Getting started with Loki (EMEA)
Thursday, October 21, at 10:00 CET / 08:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


In this webinar you’ll hear about the key benefits of Loki and get a live demo of the new set of query language features that lets you extract more labels at query time to allow for query possibilities only limited by your imagination! You’ll also learn how to create metrics from logs and alert on your logs with powerful Prometheus-style alerting rules.
Register here for the webinar.
Managing privacy in log data with Grafana Loki (APAC)
Wednesday, October 20 at 13:00 AET, 03:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


Laws for data privacy are complex and rapidly changing. Organizations can struggle to understand their responsibilities, implement the correct privacy strategy, and define which data must be part of it. Regulations such GDPR or CCPA consider log aggregation platforms as data stores, so they need to be included in readiness assessments. During this webinar, we will see how Grafana Loki can help organizations meet these requirements.
