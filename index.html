                    <span>The Linux Foundation has announced that  Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) has become an international standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

SPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.</span>

                    <span>When we last caught up with the page folio patch set, it appeared to be on
track to be pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge window.  Matthew
Wilcox duly sent a pull
request in August to make that happen.  While it is possible that
folios could still end up in 5.15, that has not happened as of this writing
and appears increasingly unlikely.  What we got instead was a lengthy
discussion on the merits of the folio approach.</span>

                    <span>This blog post by
Loris Cro makes the claim that the Zig
language  is
the solution to a lot of low-level programming problems:


	Freeing the art of systems programming from the grips of C/C++
	cruft is the only way to push for real change in our industry, but
	rewriting everything is not the answer. In the Zig project we’re
	making the C/C++ ecosystem more fun and productive. Today we have a
	compiler, a linker and a build system, and soon we’ll also have a
	package manager, making Zig a complete toolchain that can fetch
	dependencies and build C/C++/Zig projects from any target, for any
	target.


(LWN looked at Zig last year).</span>

                    <span>The Linux extended-attribute mechanism allows the attachment of metadata to
files within a filesystem.  It tends to be little used — at least, in the
absence of a security module like SELinux.  There is interest in how these
attributes work, though, as evidenced by the discussions that have
followed the posting of revisions of this
patch by Vivek Goyal, which seeks to make a seemingly small change to
the rules regarding extended attributes and special files.</span>

                    <span>Amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radio operators have been experimenting with ways to use
computers in their hobby since PCs became widely available—perhaps even
before then. While many
people picture hams either talking into a microphone or tapping a telegraph
key, many hams now type on a keyboard or even click buttons on a computer screen to make
contacts.  Even hams who still prefer to talk or use Morse code may still
use computers for some things, such as logging contacts or predicting
radio conditions. While most hams use Windows, there is no shortage of ham
radio software for Linux.</span>

                    <span>Version 3.0 of the OpenSSL TLS library has been released; the large
version-number jump (from 1.1.1) reflects a new versioning scheme.


	Most applications that worked with OpenSSL 1.1.1 will still work
	unchanged and will simply need to be recompiled (although you may
	see numerous compilation warnings about using deprecated
	APIs). Some applications may need to make changes to compile and
	work correctly, and many applications will need to be changed to
	avoid the deprecations warnings. We have put together a migration 
	guide to describe the major differences in OpenSSL 3.0 compared to
	previous releases.


OpenSSL has also been relicensed to Apache 2.0, which should end the era of
&quot;special exceptions&quot; needed to use OpenSSL in GPL-licensed applications.
See this
blog entry and the changelog for
more information.</span>
