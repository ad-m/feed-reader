                    <span>At Grafana Labs, we have a “big tent” philosophy: We believe our users should be able to determine their own observability strategy and choose their own tools, so we help users bring different data sources together.
Datadog is a powerful product used by many teams, and we hear a lot from customers about how we should further embrace and support this critical data source — which is why we created the Datadog data source plugin a few years ago. Recently, our community and customers have asked us to provide a deeper interoperability with Datadog, offering an experience that is not limited by the Datadog API rate limits.
So today we are introducing a suite of new capabilities in the plugin:

oddities in Python&#x27;s handling of Not a Number (NaN) values in
its statistics
module.  The conversation went quiet after that, but it has been

presence is less straightforward than it might seem.</span>

                    <span>Here at Grafana, we’re constantly shipping new features to help our users get the most out of Grafana Cloud. Over the last few months, we’ve made it even easier to get started with out-of-the-box dashboards and new visualizations in Grafana Cloud. We also introduced capabilities like query caching, a “prettify JSON” option and commands for cortex-tools to make your data, dashboards, and queries more efficient. Finally we’ve added new ways to customize your Grafana Cloud experience with improved reporting, synthetic monitoring and more.

                    <span>The Roundup Issue Tracker
is a flexible tool for managing issues via the web or
email. However, Roundup is useful for more than
web-based bug tracking or help-desk ticketing; it can be used as a simple 
wiki or to manage tasks
with the Getting Things
Done (GTD) 
methodology. The 20th-anniversary
edition of
Roundup,
version 2.1.0, was
released in July; it is a maintenance release, but there have been a number
of larger improvements in the last year or so. Here we introduce 
Roundup&#x27;s
features along with the
recent developments that have helped make Roundup even more useful for tracking
issues to their resolution.</span>

                    <span>Interested in learning about load testing? Join us for our next live webinar, “Intro to load testing with Grafana and k6,” on Sept. 16 at 9:30 PT / 12:30 ET / 16:30 UTC.

		
			
		
	


Observability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them
In this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.
Register now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.</span>

release on PostgreSQL.org describes an ongoing disagreement over the
PostgreSQL trademark:

                    <span>Linus has released 5.15-rc1 and closed the
merge window for this development cycle.


	So 5.15 isn&#x27;t shaping up to be a particularly large release, at
	least in number of commits. At only just over 10k non-merge
	commits, this is in fact the smallest rc1 we have had in the 5.x
	series. We&#x27;re usually hovering in the 12-14k commit range.

	That said, counting commits isn&#x27;t necessarily the best measure, and
	that might be particularly true this time around. We have a few new
	subsystems, with NTFSv3 and ksmbd standing out.</span>

FUTEX2 can help improve the performance of newer Windows games running on Linux via Wine / Steam Play&#x27;s Proton by better matching the Windows kernel behavior, but while it didn&#x27;t land for Linux 5.15, at least a new version of the patches were posted...</span>

ISSUE #559 - 12th September 2021
A few good hindsight design posts this week, both on API design and on data storage cost control. As with lots of decisions, you can apply some patterns too early, but knowing you’ll need to change later if you succeed is useful to remember.

A good post on the early decisions (in this case around data storage) that can lead to cost control discussions later. You can apply this to other systems as well.

                    <span>Grafana 8 brought with it many exciting new features, including the launch of a new alerting system and the expansion of Grafana’s live and streaming data functionality. 
We didn’t stop there. In Grafana 8.1, alongside new additions like the Geomap and Annotations panel, we introduced some new features to the Time series panel as well as two transformations to help make panel configuration more dynamic.
Gradient mode for Time series panels
Starting with the Time series panel, we’ve added a new graph style option called Gradient mode. This option enables you to color a line or bar by using the values set in the Thresholds settings or a predefined color scale. As your data crosses the defined threshold(s), the color of the line will change to match. 
Here’s a line chart with the Gradient mod…</span>

                    <span>The Linux Foundation has announced that  Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) has become an international standard (ISO/IEC 5962:2021).  SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.

Between eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.

SPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.</span>

                    <span>When we last caught up with the page folio patch set, it appeared to be on
track to be pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge window.  Matthew
Wilcox duly sent a pull
request in August to make that happen.  While it is possible that
folios could still end up in 5.15, that has not happened as of this writing
and appears increasingly unlikely.  What we got instead was a lengthy
discussion on the merits of the folio approach.</span>

                    <span>This blog post by
Loris Cro makes the claim that the Zig
language  is
the solution to a lot of low-level programming problems:


	Freeing the art of systems programming from the grips of C/C++
	cruft is the only way to push for real change in our industry, but
	rewriting everything is not the answer. In the Zig project we’re
	making the C/C++ ecosystem more fun and productive. Today we have a
	compiler, a linker and a build system, and soon we’ll also have a
	package manager, making Zig a complete toolchain that can fetch
	dependencies and build C/C++/Zig projects from any target, for any
	target.


(LWN looked at Zig last year).</span>

                    <span>We are excited to announce the launch of query caching in Grafana Cloud, which can significantly reduce load times and costs of your most popular Grafana dashboards. 
Now, when the same query is submitted repeatedly, the results will come back from the cache rather than the data source itself. This not only lowers load times for popular dashboards, but will also reduce API costs for your data sources and decrease the likelihood that those APIs will rate-limit or throttle requests. 
Here’s one common scenario in which query caching can have a great impact on organizations. For many of our users, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the busiest days of the year, when dashboards are being viewed by everyone across the org. On these mission-critical days, it’s vital that time is not lost waiting …</span>

Last year over 9,000 observability practitioners and enthusiasts from around the globe joined us virtually for our first-ever Grafana ObservabilityCON. We had a blast bringing the community together to share their observability success stories, strategies, open source projects, and lessons learned! The Grafana Labs team also packed the event with some pretty game-changing Grafana Stack announcements: Grafana Loki 2.0, and Grafana 7.3’s exemplar support, and the introduction of our open source tracing backend, Grafana Tempo.
