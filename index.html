                    <span>Over the last few years, Zero Trust, a term coined by Forrester, picked up a lot of steam. Zero Trust, in its core, is a network architecture and security framework focusing on not having a distinction between external and internal access environments, and never trusting users/roles.</span>

                    <span>On October 11, the first release candidate for Qubes OS version 4.1 was announced. Qubes OS
is a security-oriented desktop operating system that uses multiple virtual
machines (VMs or &quot;qubes&quot;) to isolate
various types of functionality.  The idea is to compartmentalize different
applications and operating-system subsystems to protect them from each
other and to limit access to the user&#x27;s data if an application is
compromised.  Version 4.1 will bring several important enhancements to
help Qubes OS continue to live up to its motto: &quot;A reasonably secure operating
system&quot;.</span>

                    <span>Are you running Kubernetes? Are you overwhelmed by the amount of telemetry you are gathering? Are you not yet gathering anything at all? 
Whether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. 
For some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.

		
			
		
	


In this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. 
The Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. 
We hope you’ll join us!</span>

                    <span>Software Freedom Conservancy has announced that it filed suit against TV maker Vizio over &quot;repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements of the General Public License (GPL)&quot;.  The organization raised the problems with Vizio in August 2018, but the company stopped responding in January 2020, according to the announcement. 

&quot;We are asking the court to require Vizio to make good on its obligations under copyleft compliance requirements,&quot; says [Software Freedom Conservancy executive director Karen] Sandler. She explains that in past litigation, the plaintiffs have always been copyright holders of the specific GPL code. In this case, Software Freedom Conservancy hopes to demonstrate that it&#x27;s not just the copyright holders, but also the receivers of the licensed code who are entitled to rights.

The lawsuit suit seeks no monetary damages, but instead seeks access to the technical information that the copyleft licenses require Vizio to provide to all customers who purchase its TVs (specifically, the plaintiff is asking for the technical information via &quot;specific performance&quot; rather than &quot;damages&quot;).


The complaint is also available.</span>

Each Grafana meetup features “bite-sized” presentations from our user community and members of the Grafana Labs team. We want to provide opportunities (even virtually!) for members of our community to connect with one another and share what they’re working on or have learned.
If you’re interested in presenting at a future Grafana Meetup, be sure to fill out our guest speaker application with your talk idea!
With five talks covering a broad spectrum of topics from creating solutions to improve accessibility to bootstrapping multi-DC cloud native stacks, we had a jam-packed agenda for our Grafana EMEA Virtual Meetup.

loadable modules have been anything but uncommon over the years.  Often,
these disagreements relate to which kernel capabilities should be available
to proprietary modules.  Sometimes, though, it hinges on the disagreements
over the best way to solve a problem.  The recent discussion around the

ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021
Seeing all of the tweets from KubeCon this week really made me miss seeing everyone in person. Devops to me has been all about the community, and while that still exists in virtual form, it’s always been one of my favourite things to meet up with, and talk to, people in this community in real life..

                    <span>I joined Grafana Labs last year as a software engineer in the Enterprise Plugins team and then moved to the Cloud Data Sources team as an engineering manager this year.
When our first company-wide hackathon was announced in June, I decided to participate for a few reasons. After moving to the manager track, I thought it was a great opportunity to do some coding between meetings. Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative. And finally, I wanted to set an example for my team. When it comes to personal development or finding personal projects, I regularly encourage the team to take a break from Business As Usual (BAU)…</span>

                    <span>The name Debian brings to mind a Linux
distribution, but the Debian project is far more than that; it is an
ongoing experiment in democratic project governance.  Debian&#x27;s processes
can result in a lot of public squabbling; one should not lose track,
though, of the fact that those processes have enabled a large community to
maintain and grow a complex distribution for decades without the benefit of
an overseeing corporate overlord.  Processes can be improved, though; a
recent proposal
from Russ Allbery gives an interesting picture of where the pain points
are and what can be made better.</span>

                    <span>The latest release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution is out: Ubuntu 21.10, code named &quot;Impish Indri&quot;.  The release notes fills in all of the details for the new features in this version, but the announcement lists some as well:


Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 makes wayland sessions available while using the 
Nvidia proprietary driver. PulseAudio 15 introduces support for Bluetooth
LDAC and AptX codecs, as well as HFP Bluetooth profiles providing better
audio quality. The recovery key feature at installation time has been
improved, with the recovery key now optional, stronger and editable.
Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 includes GNOME version 40, with a new and
improved Activities Overview design. Workspaces are now arranged
horizontally, and the overview and app grid are accessed vertically.
Each direction has accompanying keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures
and mouse actions.

Ubuntu Server 21.10 integrates recent innovations from key open
infrastructure projects like OpenStack Xena, QEMU 6.0, PHP8, libvirt 7.6,
Kubernetes, and Ceph with advanced life-cycle management tools for
multi-cloud and on-prem operations from bare metal, VMWare and
OpenStack, to every major public cloud.</span>

                    <span>Concerns over the performance of programs written in Python are often
overstated — for some use cases, at least.  But there is no getting around
the problem imposed by the infamous global interpreter lock (GIL), which
severely limits the concurrency of multi-threaded Python code.  Various
efforts to remove the GIL have been made
over the years, but none have come anywhere near the point where they would
be considered for inclusion into the CPython interpreter.  Now, though, Sam
Gross has entered
the arena with a proof-of-concept implementation that may solve the
problem for real.</span>

                    <span>The KDE project is celebrating its 25th anniversary with a special release
of the Plasma desktop.


	This time around, Plasma renews its looks and, not only do you get
	a new wallpaper, but also a gust of fresh air from an updated
	theme: Breeze - Blue Ocean. The new Breeze theme makes KDE apps and
	tools not only more attractive, but also easier to use both on the
	desktop and your phone and tablet.

	Of course, looks are not the only you can expect from Plasma 25AE:
	extra speed, increased reliability and new features have also found
	their way into the app launcher, the software manager, the Wayland
	implementation, and most other Plasma tools and utilities.


Lots of details can be found in the
changelog.</span>

                    <span>At GrafanaCONline in June, we talked about the future of machine learning at Grafana Labs. Four months later, we are excited to introduce Grafana Machine Learning for Grafana Cloud, with our metrics forecasting capability. It’s available now to all customers on Pro or Advanced plans. If you’re not already using Grafana Cloud, you can sign up for a free 14-day trial of Grafana Cloud Pro here.
In this blog post, we’ll go over some use cases and real-world examples for Grafana Machine Learning.
Using machine learning to solve real-world problems
Adaptive alerts
It’s hard to create useful alerts that stay useful over time. Static thresholds that made sense in the past no longer do. They can’t adapt to the context like expected busy or quiet periods.

                    <span>Production readiness review (PRR) is a process that originated at Google, described as the first step of site reliability engineering engagement in the company’s famous SRE book. The idea of thoroughly reviewing a product before handing over the pager is a really good one, but except for Google-scale companies, there aren’t that many organizations that can afford dedicated SRE teams.
At Grafana Labs, our product teams often take the role of the SRE teams. Moreover, due to a lot of technical similarities, we have an on-call rotation that’s responsible for multiple products — staffed with engineers from different product teams. Since there’s no official SRE onboarding, we’ve built production readiness review as a completely separate process that strives to add value by having the product in …</span>

                    <span>Grafana 8.2 was released last week, and we’re excited to announce one of its new features: contact point testing. Now users of Grafana 8 alerting can test their contact points right from the contact points page. This feature makes it easier to configure Grafana 8 alerting and gives you the confidence in knowing that your contact points are working as expected before they fire.
Here are the basics:
What are contact points?
Contact points contain configuration for zero or more contact point types (i.e. email, Slack, webhook, etc.) that receive notifications when an alert is firing. A contact point is not limited to just one contact point type and can have multiple contact point types.

                    <span>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here&#x27;s Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.

                    <span>DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #561 - 26th September 2021
One of the interesting things about curating this newsletter for so long is the historical perspective. Two related posts this week, one on the updated research in the 2021 Accelerate State of DevOps report, the other a look at the evolution of distributed tracing over the last 5 years.
