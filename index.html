their business on the internet is, sadly, a major goal for advertisers and
others today.  Web browser cookies provide a fairly well-known avenue
for tracking users as they traverse various web sites, but mobile apps are
not browsers, so that mechanism is not available.  As it turns out, though,
there are ways 
to &quot;fingerprint&quot; Android devices—and likely those of other mobile
platforms—so that the device owners can be tracked as they hop

One bit of feedback we got from last year’s ObservabilityCON was that our community wanted to hear more from other Grafana stack users about how they’re addressing observability challenges at scale. In addition to the great programming we outlined in our initial announcement, we’re delighted to announce four exciting new sessions we’ve added to this year’s agenda, featuring speakers from Unity, TomTom, TripAdvisor, Snyk, Citibank, and Ocrolus.

later than would have normally been expected due to Linus&#x27;s travel schedule.


	But please do give it a good testing to make sure we&#x27;ve shaken out

                    <span>Memory management is a balancing act in a number of ways.  The kernel must
balance the needs of current users of memory with anticipated future needs,
for example.  The kernel must 
also balance the act of reclaiming memory for other uses, which can involve
writing data to permanent storage, with the rate of data that the
underlying storage devices are able to accept.  For years, the
memory-management subsystem has used storage-device congestion as a signal
that it should slow down reclaim.  Unfortunately, that mechanism, which was
a bit questionable from the beginning, has not worked in a long time.  Mel
Gorman is now trying to fix this problem with a
patch set that moves the kernel away from the idea of waiting on congestion.</span>

                    <span>At the end of June, Grafana Labs hosted our first company-wide hackathon: a week where Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. 
The final projects ranged from a live stocks and crypto monitoring platform (which was named the overall winner and dubbed the Best Pitch) to a feature that allows Grafana users within an organization to share recordings of your favorite dashboards, panels, and interactions. 
The trio known as The Alchemists took home the prize for Best Integration/Plugin. Here’s a look at how their project came together.

                    <span>Since the early days, Unix-like systems have implemented the concept of
process priorities, where higher-priority processes are given more
CPU time to get their work done.  Implementations have changed, and
alternatives (such as deadline scheduling)
are available for specialized situations, but the core priority (or, in an
inverted sense, &quot;niceness&quot;) concept 
remains essentially the same.  What should happen, though, in a world where
increasing amounts of computing work is done outside of the CPU?  Tvrtko
Ursulin has put together a
patch set showing how the nice mechanism can be extended to GPUs as
well.</span>

                    <span>NB: This blog post is written with my Prometheus hat on.
Prometheus is the industry standard in cloud native metric monitoring with hundreds of thousands of installations, millions of users, and billions in market value.
Speaking as a member of the Prometheus team, we have seen the project become a victim of its own success. While most people may be using Prometheus, not everybody is following the same operating standards. Over the years, we’ve seen again and again that there is a ton of informal knowledge among projects and vendors about who is actually compatible with Prometheus and who might not be, but there is strong reluctance to engage in a public dispute. The result is that we have confusion in the user base about who is actually doing things the Prometheus way and who is just clai…</span>

                    <span>The Jalopnik automotive site has posted an
article on a
(relatively) new set
of open-source tools that can extract log data from Tesla cars.


	Since Tesla cars run a Debian-based operating system, navigating
	through their file systems is somewhat trivial to anyone who’s
	spent a weekend messing with virtual Linux machines (or watching
	Mr. Robot). Actually accessing the car’s memory, however, is
	considerably harder: all cases require at least partially
	disassembling the dashboard, and some even require disassembly of
	the car’s media control unit.

	Once that’s done, however, the data trove is incredible.</span>

                    <span>The Rust language project has announced the release of stable version 1.56.0 and the Rust 2021 edition. 

We wrote about plans for the Rust 2021 Edition in May. Editions are a mechanism for opt-in changes that may otherwise pose backwards compatibility risk. See the edition guide for details on how this is achieved. This is a smaller edition, especially compared to 2018, but there are still some nice quality-of-life changes that require an edition opt-in to avoid breaking some corner cases in existing code.


See the detailed 
release notes for 1.56.0 for lots more information on the release.</span>

Johannes Schindelin has posted an
extensive set of notes from the just-concluded Git Contributors&#x27;
Summit.


We held our second all-virtual Summit over the past two days. It was the
traditional unconference style meeting, with topics being proposed and
voted on right before the introduction round. It was really good to see
the human faces behind those email addresses.

32 contributors participated, and we spanned the timezones from PST to
IST.


Be sure to go into the thread for the full notes.</span>

                    <span>While the BPF virtual machine has been supported by Linux for most of
the kernel&#x27;s existence, its role for much of that time was limited to, as
its full
name (Berkeley packet filter) would suggest, filtering packets.  That began to change in 2012 with the introduction
of seccomp() filtering, and the pace picked up in 2014 with the arrival
of the extended BPF virtual machine.  At this point, BPF hooks have found their
way into many kernel subsystems.  One area that has remained BPF-free,
though, is the CPU scheduler; that could change if some version of
this patch
set from Roman Gushchin finds its way into the mainline.</span>

                    <span>Are you running Kubernetes? Are you overwhelmed by the amount of telemetry you are gathering? Are you not yet gathering anything at all? 
Whether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. 
For some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.

		
			
		
	


In this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. 
The Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. 
We hope you’ll join us!
Grafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case. Sign up for free now!</span>

                    <span>On Oct. 5, we hosted the first Grafana Virtual Meetup for an EMEA-based audience.
Each Grafana meetup features “bite-sized” presentations from our user community and members of the Grafana Labs team. We want to provide opportunities (even virtually!) for members of our community to connect with one another and share what they’re working on or have learned.
If you’re interested in presenting at a future Grafana Meetup, be sure to fill out our guest speaker application with your talk idea!
With five talks covering a broad spectrum of topics from creating solutions to improve accessibility to bootstrapping multi-DC cloud native stacks, we had a jam-packed agenda for our Grafana EMEA Virtual Meetup.

ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021
Seeing all of the tweets from KubeCon this week really made me miss seeing everyone in person. Devops to me has been all about the community, and while that still exists in virtual form, it’s always been one of my favourite things to meet up with, and talk to, people in this community in real life..

                    <span>I joined Grafana Labs last year as a software engineer in the Enterprise Plugins team and then moved to the Cloud Data Sources team as an engineering manager this year.
When our first company-wide hackathon was announced in June, I decided to participate for a few reasons. After moving to the manager track, I thought it was a great opportunity to do some coding between meetings. Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative. And finally, I wanted to set an example for my team. When it comes to personal development or finding personal projects, I regularly encourage the team to take a break from Business As Usual (BAU)…</span>

                    <span>At GrafanaCONline in June, we talked about the future of machine learning at Grafana Labs. Four months later, we are excited to introduce Grafana Machine Learning for Grafana Cloud, with our metrics forecasting capability. It’s available now to all customers on Pro or Advanced plans. If you’re not already using Grafana Cloud, you can sign up for a free 14-day trial of Grafana Cloud Pro here.
In this blog post, we’ll go over some use cases and real-world examples for Grafana Machine Learning.

It’s hard to create useful alerts that stay useful over time. Static thresholds that made sense in the past no longer do. They can’t adapt to the context like expected busy or quiet periods.

                    <span>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here&#x27;s Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.
