                    <span>Production readiness review (PRR) is a process that originated at Google, described as the first step of site reliability engineering engagement in the company’s famous SRE book. The idea of thoroughly reviewing a product before handing over the pager is a really good one, but except for Google-scale companies, there aren’t that many organizations that can afford dedicated SRE teams.
At Grafana Labs, our product teams often take the role of the SRE teams. Moreover, due to a lot of technical similarities, we have an on-call rotation that’s responsible for multiple products — staffed with engineers from different product teams. Since there’s no official SRE onboarding, we’ve built production readiness review as a completely separate process that strives to add value by having the product in …</span>

                    <span>The syzbot
kernel-fuzzing system finds an enormous number of bugs, but, since many 
of them may seem to be of a relatively low severity, they have a lower priority
when contending for the attention of developers.  A talk
at the recent Linux 
Security Summit North America reported on some research that
dug further into the bugs that syzbot has
found; the results are rather worrisome.  Rather than a pile of
difficult- or impossible-to-exploit bugs, there are numerous, more serious
problems lurking within.</span>

some of the changes and new features arriving with the upcoming
version 1.7 release of the Julia programming language.
The package system provided by the language makes it easier to
explore new language versions, while still preserving 
multiple versions of various parts of the ecosystem.  This flexible system
takes care of dependency management, both 
for writing exploratory code in the REPL and for
developing projects or libraries.</span>

                    <span>Today AMD is officially launching the Radeon RX 6600 graphics card as a trimmed down model from the Radeon RX 6600 XT that launched back in August. This new (non-XT) model has a suggested price of $329 USD and here is a look at how well this RDNA2 graphics card is performing under Linux.</span>

                    <span>Grafana 8.2 was released last week, and we’re excited to announce one of its new features: contact point testing. Now users of Grafana 8 alerting can test their contact points right from the contact points page. This feature makes it easier to configure Grafana 8 alerting and gives you the confidence in knowing that your contact points are working as expected before they fire.
Here are the basics:
What are contact points?
Contact points contain configuration for zero or more contact point types (i.e. email, Slack, webhook, etc.) that receive notifications when an alert is firing. A contact point is not limited to just one contact point type and can have multiple contact point types.

                    <span>There are many barriers to producing software that is reliable and
maintainable over the long term.  One of those is software complexity.  At
the recently concluded 2021 KVM
Forum, Paolo Bonzini
explored
this topic, using QEMU, the open source emulator
and virtualizer, as a case study.  Drawing on his experience as
a maintainer of several QEMU subsystems, he made some concrete
suggestions on how to defend against undesirable complexity.  Bonzini
used QEMU as a running example throughout the talk, hoping to make it
easier for future contributors to modify QEMU.  However, the
lessons he shared are equally applicable to many other projects.</span>

                    <span>A group of researchers at Trinity College in Dublin has released the
results of a study into the data collected by a number of Android
variants.  There are few surprises here, but the picture is still
discouraging.


	We find that the Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and Realme Android
	variants all transmit a substantial volume of data to the OS
	developer (i.e. Samsung etc) and to third-party parties that have
	pre-installed system apps (including Google, Microsoft, Heytap,
	LinkedIn, Facebook). LineageOS sends similar volumes of data to
	Google as these proprietary Android variants, but we do not observe
	the LineageOS developers themselves collecting data nor
	pre-installed system apps other than those of Google. Notably,
	/e/OS sends no information to Google or other third parties and
	sends essentially no information to the /e/OS developers.</span>

                    <span>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here&#x27;s Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.

                    <span>At the end of June, we held our first company-wide hackathon, and we were thrilled with the cross-functional creativity and team bonding that came out of it.
Team Stonks ‘n Crypto took home the prize for best pitch and overall winner of the hackathon, receiving the most votes after the five finalist teams presented at a company all-hands meeting. Here’s a look at the team and their project.

		
			
		
	


The elevator pitch
Grafana is the de facto standard for time-series visualization and OSS observability. We are also expanding Grafana’s potential by better supporting use cases outside of the IT domain — for example, business intelligence (BI).
What potential BI-ish use case/business has a massive amount of time series data, where folks like to stare at time-series graphs all day (ideall…</span>

                    <span>For the time being, the effort to add the folio
concept to the memory-management subsystem appears to be stalled, but appearances can
be deceiving.  The numerous folio discussions have produced a number of
points of consensus, though; one of those is that far too much of the
kernel has to work with page structures to get its job done.  As
an example of how a subsystem might be weaned off of struct page
usage, Matthew Wilcox has split out
the slab allocators in a 62-part patch set.  The result may be
a foreshadowing of changes to come in the memory-management subsystem.</span>

                    <span>Today we are releasing Grafana 7.5.11 and 8.1.6. These patch releases include an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 2.0.1.
All Grafana Cloud instances have been protected since 2021-09-16, and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. Grafana Enterprise customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo on 2021-09-28.
8.1.5 contained a single fix for bar chart panels. We believe that users can expedite deployment by moving from 8.1.4 to 8.1.6 directly.

Love this Stuff? I need your support on Patreon to keep this stuff going.


Sorry for the long gap in posting, but I’ve been building a new app. I’m looking for testers for my new iOS fitness app: Max reHIT Workout. It guides you through proven ​​reduced-exertion high-intensity interval workouts. If that interests you, please give it a try through TestFlight. I’d appreciate any feedback and suggestions for improvement. Thanks!

Getting started with Loki (EMEA)
Thursday, October 21, at 10:00 CET / 08:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


In this webinar you’ll hear about the key benefits of Loki and get a live demo of the new set of query language features that lets you extract more labels at query time to allow for query possibilities only limited by your imagination! You’ll also learn how to create metrics from logs and alert on your logs with powerful Prometheus-style alerting rules.
Register here for the webinar.
Managing privacy in log data with Grafana Loki (APAC)
Wednesday, October 20 at 13:00 AET, 03:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


Laws for data privacy are complex and rapidly changing. Organizations can struggle to understand their responsibilities, implement the correct privacy strategy, and define which data must be part of it. Regulations such GDPR or CCPA consider log aggregation platforms as data stores, so they need to be included in readiness assessments. During this webinar, we will see how Grafana Loki can help organizations meet these requirements.

                    <span>At the end of June, we held our first company-wide hackathon: a week for Grafanistas to unlock their creativity and think outside the box (but often within a panel).
“We have an incredibly talented team here at Grafana Labs, and so many of our most valuable features (not to mention entire projects) have come from grassroots innovation rather than top-down planning,” our CEO, Raj Dutt, said during the kickoff.  “I really want to accelerate and amplify that as we scale.”

		
			
		
	


During the hackathon, Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. Normal schedules and deliverables were pushed back a week, so that participants could focus on their hackathon projects.
A total of 125 people participated — more than a quarter of the company at the time. Many of the 49 teams were boldly cross-functional, combining sales with engineering and IT, product marketing with solutions engineering, UX with R&amp;D.

		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	


We were thrilled with the overwhelmingly positive response to the hackathon, not just from participants, but also from the entire staff, who watched presentations from the five finalist teams during an all-hands meeting and voted for the overall winner. (A panel of judges also gave out some awards in different categories.)
So over the next few weeks, we’ll showcase on the blog the cool projects the teams built, and equally importantly, the behind-the-scenes fun they had, often working with folks they hadn’t collaborated with before. The best part of the hackathon was “seeing so much get done in so little time,” says Senior Software Engineer Yas Ekinci, “and meeting Grafanistas across the globe.”</span>

The company behind Akka is Lightbend, a leader in the world of cloud native applications and architectures. In June 2021, Lightbend announced the Open Beta of Akka Serverless (General Availability, November 2021), a new class of cloud native development platform-as-a-service. 
With Akka Serverless, Lightbend co-locates “state” and functions, meaning that the data a function needs is delivered to the function when that data is needed. “We run those functions without knowing what they do or anything about their logic…</span>

ISSUE #561 - 26th September 2021
One of the interesting things about curating this newsletter for so long is the historical perspective. Two related posts this week, one on the updated research in the 2021 Accelerate State of DevOps report, the other a look at the evolution of distributed tracing over the last 5 years.
