                    <span>Today we are releasing Grafana 7.5.11 and 8.1.6. These patch releases include an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 2.0.1.
Grafana Cloud instances have already been patched, and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. Grafana Enterprise customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.
8.1.5 contained a single fix for bar chart panels. We believe that users can expedite deployment by moving from 8.1.4 to 8.1.6 directly.

report on its goal of running Linux on Mac M1 hardware.

Earlier this year we saw the absolute lowest level drivers being merged into the kernel. Those are important for bring-up, but to get a usable system we need many more. Over September we’ve seen a lot of action on this front, with many important drivers now in review or even already merged for Linux 5.16. The goal of the Asahi Linux project is to upstream everything into the Linux kernel, so all our drivers are eventually headed for upstream review.</span>

Getting started with Loki (EMEA)
Thursday, October 21, at 10:00 CET / 08:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


In this webinar you’ll hear about the key benefits of Loki and get a live demo of the new set of query language features that lets you extract more labels at query time to allow for query possibilities only limited by your imagination! You’ll also learn how to create metrics from logs and alert on your logs with powerful Prometheus-style alerting rules.

Managing privacy in log data with Grafana Loki (APAC)
Wednesday, October 20 at 13:00 AET, 03:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


Laws for data privacy are complex and rapidly changing. Organizations can struggle to understand their responsibilities, implement the correct privacy strategy, and define which data must be part of it. Regulations such GDPR or CCPA consider log aggregation platforms as data stores, so they need to be included in readiness assessments. During this webinar, we will see how Grafana Loki can help organizations meet these requirements.

                    <span>Developers working in languages like C or C++ have access to
two competing compilers — GCC and LLVM — either of which can usually get
the job done.  Rust developers, though, are currently limited to the
LLVM-based rustc compiler.  While rustc works well, there
are legitimate reasons for developers to wish for an alternative.  As it
turns out, there are two different ways to compile Rust using GCC under
development, though neither is ready at the moment.  Developers of both
approaches came to the 2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference to present the status of their work.</span>

ISSUE #562 - 3rd October 2021
Lots of new tools this week, along with several posts on Observability, data center monitoring and SLOs. Quite a classic operations feel this issue.

                    <span>The 5.15-rc4 kernel prepatch is out for
testing.


	One thing standing out in the diffs might be the m68k &#x27;set_fs()&#x27;
	removal - not really a regression fix, but it has been pending for
	a while, and it turned out that the problems attributed to it were
	due to an entirely unrelated m68k signal handling issue. So with
	that fixed, we could get rid of set_fs from another architecture.


See this article for information on
set_fs() and its removal.</span>

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/871726/rss">

                    <span>Paul McKenney has started a blog series on Rust for the Linux kernel.  He has posted six of a planned 11 articles, though several are labeled as &quot;under construction&quot;.

This series focuses mostly on use cases and opportunities, rather than on any non-trivial solutions. Please note that I am not in any way attempting to dictate or limit Rust&#x27;s level of ambition. I am instead noting the memory-model consequences of a few potential levels of ambition, ranging from &quot;portions of a few drivers&quot;, &quot;a few drivers&quot;, &quot;some core code&quot; and up to and including &quot;the entire kernel&quot;. Greater levels of ambition will require greater willingness to accommodate a wider variety of LKMM [Linux-kernel memory model] requirements.

[...]
These blog posts will therefore present approaches ranging upwards from trivial workarounds. But be warned that some of the high-quality approaches require profound reworking of compiler backends that have thus far failed to spark joy in the hearts of compiler writers. In addition, Rust enjoys considerable use outside of the Linux kernel, for example, as something into which to rewrite inefficient Python scripts. (A megawatt here, a megawatt there, and pretty soon you are talking about real power consumption!) Therefore, there are probably sharp limits beyond which the core Rust developers are unwilling to go.</span>

                    <span>At the end of June, we held our first company-wide hackathon: a week for Grafanistas to unlock their creativity and think outside the box (but often within a panel).
“We have an incredibly talented team here at Grafana Labs, and so many of our most valuable features (not to mention entire projects) have come from grassroots innovation rather than top-down planning,” our CEO, Raj Dutt, said during the kickoff.  “I really want to accelerate and amplify that as we scale.”

		
			
		
	


During the hackathon, Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. Normal schedules and deliverables were pushed back a week, so that participants could focus on their hackathon projects.
A total of 125 people participated — more than a quarter of the company at the time. Many of the 49 teams were boldly cross-functional, combining sales with engineering and IT, product marketing with solutions engineering, UX with R&amp;D.

		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	


We were thrilled with the overwhelmingly positive response to the hackathon, not just from participants, but also from the entire staff, who watched presentations from the five finalist teams during an all-hands meeting and voted for the overall winner. (A panel of judges also gave out some awards in different categories.)
So over the next few weeks, we’ll showcase on the blog the cool projects the teams built, and equally importantly, the behind-the-scenes fun they had, often working with folks they hadn’t collaborated with before. The best part of the hackathon was “seeing so much get done in so little time,” says Senior Software Engineer Yas Ekinci, “and meeting Grafanistas across the globe.”</span>

                    <span>Much of the free-software development world has adopted Git forges (such as
GitHub, GitLab, or sourcehut) with enthusiasm.  The kernel community has
not.  Reasons for that reticence vary, but one that is often heard is that
these forges simply don&#x27;t work well at the scale needed for the kernel
project.  At a
Kernel-Summit session during the 2021 
Linux Plumbers conference, Donald Zickus and Prarit Bhargava sought to
show how Red Hat has put GitLab to good use to support its kernel team.
Not only can these forges work for kernel development, they said, but
moving to a forge can bring a number of advantages.</span>

The company behind Akka is Lightbend, a leader in the world of cloud native applications and architectures. In June 2021, Lightbend announced the Open Beta of Akka Serverless (General Availability, November 2021), a new class of cloud native development platform-as-a-service. 
With Akka Serverless, Lightbend co-locates “state” and functions, meaning that the data a function needs is delivered to the function when that data is needed. “We run those functions without knowing what they do or anything about their logic…</span>

                    <span>Not so long ago, development teams working for the U.S. Department of Defense could take anywhere from three to ten years to deliver software. “It was mostly teams using waterfall, no minimum viable product, no incremental delivery, and no feedback loop from end users,” Nicolas M. Chaillan, Chief Software Officer of the U.S. Air Force, said in a CNCF case study. “Particularly when it comes to AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, everyone realized we have to move faster.”
So in 2018, the DoD launched the Enterprise DevSecOps Initiative to modernize DoD software development in order to deliver secure, resilient applications “at the speed of relevance.” The initiative included a mandate to use Kubernetes container orchestration and other open source technologies and the establishment of Iron Bank, a rigorously vetted repository of digitally signed, hardened container images for best-of-breed development tools and software capabilities.
Today, we’re pleased to announce that Grafana, Grafana Enterprise, and Grafana Loki have received formal authorization from Iron Bank, which allows the 100,000 employees and contractors working on Department of Defense software, both classified and unclassified, to easily select and immediately deploy our software without additional approvals and security certifications. Prometheus, the CNCF monitoring project that Grafana Labs heavily contributes to, has also been authorized by Iron Bank.
“DoD teams need the best tools to build critical applications better and faster,” said Chaillan. “Grafana is a critical option for our developers as a unique visualization and dashboarding capability. Its interoperability with a multitude of data sources is crucial for the DoD; we’re one of the largest organizations on the planet, and we know that one size doesn’t fit all. Iron Bank authorization for Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki gives our teams instant access to powerful observability tools that are essential for keeping DoD software running reliably and having the right insights.”</span>

                    <span>Good news for Salesforce users: With the new Salesforce plugin for Grafana, available now with an Enterprise license, you can instantly visualize your SFDC data in Grafana dashboards.
Plus, Grafana allows you to visualize the Salesforce data alongside all sorts of other data. One interesting use case is correlating sales data to system metrics and logs, which would be valuable if your company uses any software systems at all to help generate revenue.
When we think of observing systems, no matter how complex they get, we are ultimately trying to maximize one of two levers: increase revenue or decrease costs. Salesforce is the ultimate tool for describing the revenue pipeline. With the Salesforce plugin for Grafana, you can bring observability to your sales pipeline.
Why correlate sales data…</span>

                    <span>One of the experiences I’ve truly enjoyed over my first year as a senior solutions engineer here at Grafana Labs has been learning from our community and customers about their own Grafana journeys. I’ve been impressed by some remarkable dashboards for home automation, personal health data visualizations, family Minecraft statistics, and energy usage projects. At the same time, I’ve seen network performance management teams share their delight with Grafana Enterprise Metrics, and operation teams appreciating how quickly they can ingest and search through petabytes of real-time logging with Grafana Enterprise Logs. Everybody has a personal observability story, and here is one of mine…

                    <span>I’ve spent most of my career working with tech in various forms, and for the last ten years or so, I’ve focused a lot on building, maintaining, and operating robust, reliable systems.
This has led me to put a lot of time into researching, evaluating, and implementing different solutions for automatic failure detection, monitoring, and more recently, observability.
Before we get started: What is observability? Observability is the practice of taking an opaque system, or action in a system, and making it available for us to inspect and reason about through its outputs.
For instance, consider an interaction from a user that results in an order being placed through the orders API. If that order placement goes south, to what degree are we able to debug and troubleshoot that? Are we able to see …</span>

                    <span>Martin Falch, co-owner and head of sales and marketing at CSS Electronics, is an expert on “CAN bus” data. Martin works closely with end users, typically OEM engineers, across diverse industries (automotive, heavy-duty, maritime, industrial). He is passionate about open source software and has been spearheading the integration of the CANedge with InfluxDB databases and Grafana telematics dashboards.
At CSS Electronics, we develop industrial-grade, simple-to-use CAN bus data loggers. In short, CAN bus is the protocol responsible for communicating message-based telemetry within practically all vehicles – heavy-duty vehicles, cars, mining trucks, and more. It is also used extensively in the monitoring of many types of machinery, ships, planes, drones, and robots.

ISSUE #559 - 12th September 2021

SIGv4 rigorously authenticates every request individually and it’s reassuringly simple. It uses fast cryptography based on the HMAC algorithm to strongly authenticate every request.
