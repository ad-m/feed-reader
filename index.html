                    <span>Cloudflare has a broad range of products -- ranging from security, to performance and serverless compute. These products are built by multiple teams in close collaboration and delivering those products can be a complex task. So ever wonder how we do so consistently and safely at scale?</span>

                    <span>The Fedora 35
release has been announced.


	No matter what variant of Fedora you use, you’re getting the latest
	the open source world has to offer. Following our “First”
	foundation, we’ve updated key programming language and system
	library packages, including Python 3.10, Perl 5.34, and PHP
	8.0. Fedora Linux 35 also includes the 1.0 release of firewalld,
	the modern firewall service.

                    <span>I joined Grafana Labs as a software engineer in October to help build out a team focused on OpenTelemetry, and within a few weeks, I was promptly encouraged to run for a seat on the OpenTelemetry board.
Every year, the OpenTelemetry community holds elections for a few seats on the Governance Committee board, which oversees the project at large. The results of this year’s elections are now available, and I am glad to share that I have been elected to serve on the board!
I’m thankful for every one of the votes I got and I am honored to work with the members of the board. I believe that the results of this election reflect my contributions to the community over the past few years, including code contributions, speaking engagements, blog posts, and supporting users.
It is also a reflection of the commitment Grafana Labs has to investing in OpenTelemetry. I wouldn’t have been a candidate without the company’s support and without the freedom to dedicate official working hours to this endeavor.
Grafana Labs’ interest in OpenTelemetry is not new: We have been supporting OTLP as a possible input protocol for Grafana Tempo since its inception, and our Grafana Agent embeds parts of the OpenTelemetry Collector.
As a member of the board, my goals align with the platform I submitted for the election:
Community: Ensure that OpenTelemetry’s decisions continue to be compatible with the interests of the broader open source observability ecosystem, including users, developers, projects, and vendors.
Diversity: Create new and strengthen existing diversity initiatives, like Outreachy, across OpenTelemetry’s SIGs and projects.
I’m looking forward to collaborating with the members of the board for the next two years!
Are you interested in joining Grafana Labs? Come work with me and other Grafanistas on OpenTelemetry and other parts of the observability ecosystem!</span>

memory-management subsystem and isolate it from other parts of the kernel.</span>

nominations for the Free Software

The dedication of the developers, documentation writers, community
organizers, and volunteers of the free software movement is what has helped

liberation in the years the free software movement has been
active. Just using free software makes you part of our collective journey
to freedom, but some go above and beyond in their dedication to the free

                    <span>The latest branded and trademarked vulnerability type is called &quot;Trojan Source&quot;.  By playing tricks
with Unicode bidirectional support, an attacker can create malicious code
that appears to be benign to reviewers.  &quot;The attack is to use
control characters embedded in comments and strings to reorder source code
characters in a way that changes its logic.&quot;  Various releases,
including Rust
1.56.1,
are being made to address this problem.</span>

                    <span>Linus has released the 5.15 kernel after
another nine-week development cycle.


	This release may have started out with some -Werror pain, but it
	calmed down fairly quickly and on the whole 5.15 was fair small and
	calm. Let&#x27;s hope for more of the same - without Werror issues this
	time - for the upcoming merge window.


The code name for this release has been set to &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;.

Significant features in this release include:
the realtime
preemption locking code,
descriptorless files for io_uring,
BPF timers,
the removal of mandatory file-locking support,
the ksmbd SMB filesystem server (but see this
article),
printk() indexing,
the process_mrelease() system
call,
The DAMON memory-management optimization
system,
the ntfs3 filesystem implementation,
and much more.  See the
KernelNewbies 5.15 page for more information.</span>

Current location/time zone: I live in Bristol, U.K., which at time of writing is in the UTC+1 time zone. Bristol has been described as “lively yet laid-back” and “one of the most cosmopolitan centers outside London.” I like it because it has an incredibly high density of independent breweries.
What do you do at Grafana Labs? I work on the systems supporting Grafana Cloud, specifically those systems managing the Grafana instances we run for our customers. We also identify opportunities for improvement that arise when running Graf…</span>

                    <span>For all of you youngsters out there, the Internet has always been
omnipresent, computers are something you carry in your pocket, the Unix
wars are about as relevant as the War of 1812, and the term &quot;NIS&quot; doesn&#x27;t
ring a bell.  But, for a certain class of Unix old-timer, NIS has a distinct
place in history — and, perhaps, in still-deployed systems.  So the
suggestion that Fedora might drop support for NIS has proved to be a bit of
a wakeup call for some.</span>

                    <span>Software Freedom Conservancy has had several exemptions granted that it requested to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by the US Library of Congress for activities of interest to free-software developers:

Software Freedom Conservancy is proud to announce that its efforts to
stand up for the rights of FOSS developers have been successful and that
it has been granted almost all of the exemptions that it requested in
the Librarian of Congress&#x27; recent rule making, according to the final
rule Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection
Systems for Access Control Technologies, which was published today.
Effective today, the Librarian of Congress (&quot;LoC&quot;) granted DMCA
exemptions for installing alternate firmwares on routers and for
investigating copyleft compliance, and the exemption that Software
Freedom Conservancy previously applied for and received on Smart TVs was
also expanded. While our formal request to extend the security research
exemption to include privacy research was not granted, the Register
clarified that privacy research is indeed included in security research.
Our executive director, Karen Sandler, also participated as an
individual in a request to expand the existing exemption for medical
devices which was also successful.</span>

                    <span>At the end of June, Grafana Labs hosted our first company-wide hackathon: a week where Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. 
The final projects ranged from a live stocks and crypto monitoring platform (which was named the overall winner and dubbed the Best Pitch) to a feature that allows Grafana users within an organization to share recordings of your favorite dashboards, panels, and interactions. 
The trio known as The Alchemists took home the prize for Best Integration/Plugin. Here’s a look at how their project came together.

                    <span>NB: This blog post is written with my Prometheus hat on.
Prometheus is the industry standard in cloud native metric monitoring with hundreds of thousands of installations, millions of users, and billions in market value.
Speaking as a member of the Prometheus team, we have seen the project become a victim of its own success. While most people may be using Prometheus, not everybody is following the same operating standards. Over the years, we’ve seen again and again that there is a ton of informal knowledge among projects and vendors about who is actually compatible with Prometheus and who might not be, but there is strong reluctance to engage in a public dispute. The result is that we have confusion in the user base about who is actually doing things the Prometheus way and who is just clai…</span>

                    <span>Here at Grafana Labs, when we’re building integrations for Grafana Cloud, we’re often thinking about how to help users get started on their observability journeys. We like to focus some of our attention on the different technologies you might come across along the way. That way, we can share our tips on the best ways to interact with them while you’re using Grafana products.
In this post, I’m going to focus on the open-source, distributed storage system Ceph, our latest integration available in Grafana Cloud (including the forever-free tier).
The basics
Ceph implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, then provides 3-in-1 interfaces for object, block, and file-level storage. The goal is to offer a completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, w…</span>

Whether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. 
For some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.

		
			
		
	


In this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. 
The Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. 
We hope you’ll join us!
Grafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case. Sign up for free now!</span>

ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021
Seeing all of the tweets from KubeCon this week really made me miss seeing everyone in person. Devops to me has been all about the community, and while that still exists in virtual form, it’s always been one of my favourite things to meet up with, and talk to, people in this community in real life..

                    <span>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here&#x27;s Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.

Love this Stuff? I need your support on Patreon to keep this stuff going.


Sorry for the long gap in posting, but I’ve been building a new app. I’m looking for testers for my new iOS fitness app: Max reHIT Workout. It guides you through proven ​​reduced-exertion high-intensity interval workouts. If that interests you, please give it a try through TestFlight. I’d appreciate any feedback and suggestions for improvement. Thanks!
