                    <span>The GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) has announced the release of version 9.0 of &quot;the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities&quot; used by the GNU operating system and various Linux distributions.  In the year and a half or so since the last major release (8.32), various new features were added, including:

cp has changed how it handles data

     
enables CoW [copy on write] by default (through FICLONE ioctl),
     
uses copy offload where available (through copy_file_range),
     
detects holes differently (though SEEK_HOLE)
     
This also applies to mv and install.</span>

As a reminder this is their mini-ITX development board that is powered by their U740 SoC and features 16GB of DDR4 system memory, one PCI Express x16 slot that can work with AMD Radeon graphics cards on Linux, and other features. It&#x27;s been a delight playing with this developer platform and enclosed are some early benchmarks as well showing off the U740 performance as well as how the Linux software support/performance has been evolving.</span>

This has led me to put a lot of time into researching, evaluating, and implementing different solutions for automatic failure detection, monitoring, and more recently, observability.

                    <span>Here&#x27;s a
lengthy missive from Lennart Poettering taking Linux distributors to
task for inadequately protecting systems from physical attacks.


	So, does the scheme so far implemented by generic Linux
	distributions protect us against the latter two scenarios?
	Unfortunately not at all. Because distributions set up disk
	encryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an
	attacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute
	force your password. What&#x27;s worse: since code authentication ends
	at the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,
	backdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd
	any way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.


The article contains a lot of suggestions for how to do things better.</span>

                    <span>For the second year in a row, the GNU Tools Cauldron (the annual gathering
of GNU toolchain developers) has been held as a dedicated track at the
online Linux Plumbers
Conference.  For the 2021 event, that track started with a talk by
David Malcolm on his work with the GCC -fanalyzer option, which
provides access to a number of static-analysis features.  Quite a bit has
been happening with -fanalyzer and more is on the way with the
upcoming GCC 12 release, including, possibly, a set of checks that
have already found at least one vulnerability in the kernel.</span>

                    <span>Over at the Guix-HPC blog, Ludovic Courtès writes about trying to package the PyTorch machine-learning library for the Guix distribution.  Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:

The first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.

The second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or &quot;vendors&quot;, as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.</span>

at the 2021 Linux
Plumbers Conference would be focused rather differently.  But, as we reported earlier in September, his folio patch set ran into some, perhaps
unexpected, opposition and, ultimately, did not land in the mainline for
5.15.  Instead of discussing how to use folios as part
of the File
Systems microconference, he led a discussion that was, at least in part, on the
path forward for them.</span>

release of GNOME 41.

The most notable changes this in release include an improved Software app, new multitasking settings, and enhanced power management features. With these changes, GNOME is smarter, more flexible, and offers a richer and more engaging experience than ever before.

The new release also comes with significant improvements for developers, including a new developer documentation website, a major new version of the Human Interface Guidelines, new features in the Builder IDE, GTK 4 enhancements, and much more.</span>

some of the &quot;little things&quot; featured in the upcoming PostgreSQL 14
release.


	And now in PostgreSQL 14 there is this seemingly small update,
	pipeline mode, which, according to the docs, allows applications to
	send a query without having to read the result of the previously
	sent query.  Taking advantage of the pipeline mode, a client will
	wait less for the server, since multiple queries/results can be
	sent/received in a single network transaction.</span>

                    <span>The Google security blog provides
an overview of what is being done to address memory-safety problems in
the Chrome browser.


	In parallel, we’ll be exploring whether we can use a memory safe
	language for parts of Chrome in the future. The leading contender
	is Rust, invented by our friends at Mozilla. This is (largely)
	compile-time safe; that is, the Rust compiler spots mistakes with
	pointers before the code even gets to your device, and thus there’s
	no performance penalty. Yet there are open questions about whether
	we can make C++ and Rust work well enough together. Even if we
	started writing new large components in Rust tomorrow, we’d be
	unlikely to eliminate a significant proportion of security
	vulnerabilities for many years.</span>

                    <span>Martin Falch, co-owner and head of sales and marketing at CSS Electronics, is an expert on “CAN bus” data. Martin works closely with end users, typically OEM engineers, across diverse industries (automotive, heavy-duty, maritime, industrial). He is passionate about open source software and has been spearheading the integration of the CANedge with InfluxDB databases and Grafana telematics dashboards.
At CSS Electronics, we develop industrial-grade, simple-to-use CAN bus data loggers. In short, CAN bus is the protocol responsible for communicating message-based telemetry within practically all vehicles – heavy-duty vehicles, cars, mining trucks, and more. It is also used extensively in the monitoring of many types of machinery, ships, planes, drones, and robots.

                    <span>Alyssa Rosenzweig reports
that the open-source Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs has achieved official
conformance on Mali-G52 for OpenGL ES 3.1.

This important milestone is a step forward for the open source driver, as it now certifies Panfrost for use in commercial products containing Mali G52 and paves the way for further conformance submissions on other Mali GPUs.</span>

                    <span>Middleboxes are,
unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today&#x27;s internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they
see.  The effects of those devices on users of the networks they reign over may be
unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some
recently reported research, it turns out that middleboxes can be abused to 
inflict denial-of-service (DoS) attacks elsewhere on the net.</span>

Anyone with push access to a repository can view these insights, which include: full clones, visitors from the past 14 days, referring sites, and popular content in the traffic graph. Seeing the data is as easy as going to the main page of your repo, clicking Insights (under the repository name), and then clicking Traffic (in the left sidebar).

                    <span>This blog post was written with Senior Technical Writer Karen Miller.
Dropped log lines due to out-of-order timestamps can be a thing of the past! Allowing out-of-order writes has been one of the most-requested features for Loki, and we’re happy to announce that in the upcoming v2.4 release, the requirement to have log lines arrive in order by timestamp will be lifted. Simple configuration will allow out-of-order writes for Loki v2.4. If you’re using Grafana Cloud, our fully managed platform integrating metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards, out-of-order writes are already accepted.
The restriction and its effects
From Loki’s inception as a memory-efficient log aggregation tool, it has required that log entries within a stream arrive in time order. Log entries written to Loki in violation …</span>

Datadog is a powerful product used by many teams, and we hear a lot from customers about how we should further embrace and support this critical data source — which is why we created the Datadog data source plugin a few years ago. Recently, our community and customers have asked us to provide a deeper interoperability with Datadog, offering an experience that is not limited by the Datadog API rate limits.
So today we are introducing a suite of new capabilities in the plugin:

Observability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them
In this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.
Register now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.</span>

ISSUE #559 - 12th September 2021
A few good hindsight design posts this week, both on API design and on data storage cost control. As with lots of decisions, you can apply some patterns too early, but knowing you’ll need to change later if you succeed is useful to remember.

A good post on the early decisions (in this case around data storage) that can lead to cost control discussions later. You can apply this to other systems as well.

                    <span>Grafana 8 brought with it many exciting new features, including the launch of a new alerting system and the expansion of Grafana’s live and streaming data functionality. 
We didn’t stop there. In Grafana 8.1, alongside new additions like the Geomap and Annotations panel, we introduced some new features to the Time series panel as well as two transformations to help make panel configuration more dynamic.
Gradient mode for Time series panels
Starting with the Time series panel, we’ve added a new graph style option called Gradient mode. This option enables you to color a line or bar by using the values set in the Thresholds settings or a predefined color scale. As your data crosses the defined threshold(s), the color of the line will change to match. 
Here’s a line chart with the Gradient mod…</span>

                    <span>In the time it takes to read this sentence, the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service will handle several billion requests. Pretty close to every one of those requests is authenticated using the AWS SIGv4 protocol, before IAM authorization policy is applied to check if the request is allowed or not. 
I didn’t have a hand in designing the AWS SIGv4 protocol so hopefully it’s not too biased to say that I dearly love how AWS SIGv4 works. SIGv4 rigorously authenticates every request individually and it’s reassuringly simple. It uses fast cryptography based on the HMAC algorithm to strongly authenticate every request. Customer’s secrets never appear in these requests directly, and there are neat properties built in that mean every request is finely scoped down and signed with a token…</span>
