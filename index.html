                    <span>Should disaster strike, business continuity can require more than just periodic data backups. A full recovery that meets the business’s recovery time objectives (RTOs) must also include the infrastructure, operating systems, applications, and configurations used to process their data. The growing threats of ransomware highlight the need to be able to perform a full point-in-time […]</span>

                    <span>At Grafana Labs, we are continuing to build integrations that make it easier than ever to observe your systems, no matter which tools or software you choose. 
Today, we’re excited to talk about the latest integration available in Grafana Cloud: the AWS CloudWatch metrics integration, the first of our fully managed integrations that makes it simple to connect and visualize your data in Grafana.
AWS CloudWatch: plugin vs. integration
AWS CloudWatch is a powerful tool to monitor the resources you have provisioned in the cloud and to help understand their usage, utilization, and performance. In fact, CloudWatch is such an important tool to monitor AWS services that it is already one of the most popular core Grafana data source plugins. 
With the CloudWatch integration, you will now be able to …</span>

                    <span>Even encrypted data sent on the internet leaves some footprints—metadata
about where packets originate, where they are bound, and when they are sent. 
Mix networks are
meant to hide that metadata by routing packets through various intermediate
nodes to try to thwart the traffic analysis used by nation-state-level
adversaries to identify &quot;opponents&quot; of various kinds. Tor is perhaps the
best-known mix network, but there are others that make different
tradeoffs to increase the security of their users.  Rollercoaster
is a recently announced mechanism that extends the functionality of mix
networks in order to more efficiently communicate among groups.</span>

                    <span>On 2021-10-29, initial support for Prometheus Agent was merged, and it is slated for inclusion in Prometheus v2.32!
This feature has a bit of a lengthy history to it: 
On 2020-03-18, we announced Grafana Agent, a subset of Prometheus that didn’t need the TSDB for sending metrics with remote write.
On 2020-12-17, Prometheus Team held a dev summit where they agreed to cover Grafana Agent-like functionality in the official Prometheus project. 
On 2021-01-27, I published a proposal for how we could do this by moving Grafana Agent code upstream. 
On 2021-05-05, the initial PR to move Grafana Agent code upstream was opened. 
On 2021-10-29, that PR was merged into Prometheus’s main branch. 
It took a little while to get to where we are today, but I’m thrilled that we were able to use the Grafana …</span>

                    <span>The Trojan Source vulnerabilities have been
rippling through various development
communities since their disclosure on 
November 1.  The oddities that can arise when handling Unicode, and
bidirectional Unicode in particular, in a programming 
language have led Rust, for
example, to check for
the problematic code points in strings and comments and, by default,
refuse to compile if they are present.  Python has chosen a different path,
but work is underway to help inform programmers of the kinds of pitfalls that
Trojan Source has highlighted.</span>

5.16-rc1 and ended the 5.16 merge window on November 14, as
expected.  At that point, 12,321 non-merge changesets had been pulled into
the mainline; about 5,500 since our summary of
the first half of the merge window was written.  As is usually the case,
the patch mix in the latter part of the merge window tended more toward
fixes, but there were a number other changes as well.</span>

	Anyway, it&#x27;s not a huge release, although it&#x27;s also not a
	remarkably small one like 5.15 was (ok, &quot;remarkably small&quot; is
	relative, when even such small releases have 10k+
	commits).. There&#x27;s a bit of everything in here, and you can look to
	the appended mergelog for some kind of flavor, but I guess the
	folio work is worth mentioning, since it&#x27;s an unusually core thing
	that we don&#x27;t tend to see most releases.</span>

In particular, bad news for Alder Lake that is already seeing the Linux performance trailing Windows 11 seemingly due to the lack of Thread Director integration right now in the kernel and any other missing optimizations around Intel&#x27;s hybrid architecture. A new feature of Linux 5.16 is unfortunately having unintended regressions for Alder Lake with at least the flagship Core i9 12900K.

Grafana Labs Principal Solutions Engineer Patrick Brennan will demonstrate how working with Grafana’s opinionated stack — Prometheus for metrics, Loki for logs, and Tempo for traces — can help you not only reduce MTTR. You’ll also better understand the state of your environment and how to address underlying issues that could be contributing to ongoing issues.

                    <span>Over on the Google Security blog, Jonathan Metzman announced the release of ClusterFuzzLite, which is &quot;a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before&quot;.   ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.

Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, “When the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can&#x27;t detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.”

[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if you’re interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.</span>

                    <span>The memory-management subsystem remains one of the most complex parts of
the kernel, with an ongoing reliance on various heuristics for

improve its functionality.  A number of memory-management patches are

have, thus far, generated far more publicity than examples of actual
exploits, addressing the problem still seems like a good thing to do.
There are several places where defenses could be put into place; text
editors, being the place where developers look at a lot of code, are one
obvious example.  The discussion of how to enhance Emacs in this regard has
made it clear, though, that there are multiple opinions about how an editor
should flag potential attacks.</span>

                    <span>On November 10, the Go programming language community celebrated the 12th anniversary of its release as open-source software.  The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:

In February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.

Generics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesn’t, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.</span>

                    <span>Loki 2.4 is here!
It comes with a very long list of cool new features, but there are a couple things I really want to focus on here. 
Loki can now accept out of order writes
Running Loki is easier than ever
Be sure to check out the full release notes and of course the upgrade guide to get all the latest info about upgrading Loki. Also check out our ObservabilityCON 2021 session Why Loki is easier to use and operate than ever before.

                    <span>A critical part of managing modern software development is setting up and running an on-call rotation. But that often involves significant toil, in part because many of the existing tools are cumbersome and not developer-friendly.  
That’s why we’re excited to announce Grafana OnCall, an easy-to-use on-call management tool that will help reduce toil in on-call management through simpler workflows and interfaces tailored for devs. It’s now available in beta preview to all Grafana Cloud users with both free and paid plans.
