                    <span>Martin Falch, co-owner and head of sales and marketing at CSS Electronics, is an expert on “CAN bus” data. Martin works closely with end users, typically OEM engineers, across diverse industries (automotive, heavy-duty, maritime, industrial). He is passionate about open source software and has been spearheading the integration of the CANedge with InfluxDB databases and Grafana telematics dashboards.
At CSS Electronics, we develop industrial-grade, simple-to-use CAN bus data loggers. In short, CAN bus is the protocol responsible for communicating message-based telemetry within practically all vehicles – heavy-duty vehicles, cars, mining trucks, and more. It is also used extensively in the monitoring of many types of machinery, ships, planes, drones, and robots.

                    <span>Alyssa Rosenzweig reports
that the open-source Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs has achieved official
conformance on Mali-G52 for OpenGL ES 3.1.

This important milestone is a step forward for the open source driver, as it now certifies Panfrost for use in commercial products containing Mali G52 and paves the way for further conformance submissions on other Mali GPUs.</span>

                    <span>Middleboxes are,
unfortunately in many ways, a big part of today&#x27;s internet.  While middleboxes
inhabit the same physical niche as routers, they are not aimed at packet forwarding;
instead they are meant to monitor and manipulate the packets that they
see.  The effects of those devices on users of the networks they reign over may be
unfortunate as well, but the rest of the internet is only affected when
trying to communicate with those users—or so it was thought.  Based on some
recently reported research, it turns out that middleboxes can be abused to 
inflict denial-of-service (DoS) attacks elsewhere on the net.</span>

                    <span>If you want to understand the popularity of your GitHub repositories, knowing the number of stars isn’t enough. GitHub understands this, and that’s why the team released traffic insights.
Anyone with push access to a repository can view these insights, which include: full clones, visitors from the past 14 days, referring sites, and popular content in the traffic graph. Seeing the data is as easy as going to the main page of your repo, clicking Insights (under the repository name), and then clicking Traffic (in the left sidebar).
Voila! You should see something like this:

		
			
		
	


Fancy.
But what if you have lots of repos?
At k6, we have tons of open source repositories for integrations, extensions, examples, and docs. And the number continues to rise.

                    <span>Ben Hoyt has published a critical
overview of the Python 3.10 pattern-matching feature.


	As shown above, there are cases where match really
	shines. But they are few and far between, mostly when handling
	syntax trees and writing parsers. A lot of code does have
	if ... elif chains, but these are often either
	plain switch-on-value, where elif works almost as well, or
	the conditions they’re testing are a more complex combination of
	tests that don’t fit into case patterns (unless you use awkward
	case _ if cond clauses, but that’s strictly worse than
	elif).


(Pattern matching has been covered here as
well).</span>

So I&#x27;ve spent a fair amount of this week trying to sort out all the
odd warnings, and I want to particularly thank Guenter Roeck for his
work on tracking where the build failures due to -Werror come from.

Is it done? No. But on the whole I&#x27;m feeling fairly good about this
all, even if it has meant that I&#x27;ve been looking at some really odd
and grotty code. Who knew I&#x27;d still worry about some odd EISA driver
on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)</span>

What do you do at Grafana Labs?
I am a Senior Technical Writer. My primary focus is improving the open source documentation for the Grafana product. The docs-as-code practice, along with the opportunity to improve community adoption, motivated me to join Grafana Labs. 
What open source projects do you contribute to?
Working at Grafana gave me my first exposure to the open source world. I would love to contribute to other projects in the near future.

post from Christian Schaller describing a number of the
desktop-oriented improvements that can be expected in the Fedora 35
release.


	And I know some people will wonder why we spent so much time
	working with NVidia around their binary driver, but the reality is
	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional
	Linux workstation space, and there are lot of people who either
	would end up not using Linux or using Linux with X without it,
	including a lot of Red Hat customers and Fedora users. And that is
	what I and my team are here for at the end of the day, to make sure
	Red Hat customers are able to get their job done using their Linux
	systems.</span>

                    <span>Ariadne Conill looks
at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does
	paramiko and Ansible.</span>

introducing the effort to bring the Rust programming language into the 
Linux kernel.  On the second day, conference organizer Miguel Ojeda shifted
to presenting the Rust language itself with an emphasis on what Rust can
provide for kernel development.  The result was a useful resource for
anybody who is curious about this project, but who has not yet had the time

Dropped log lines due to out-of-order timestamps can be a thing of the past! Allowing out-of-order writes has been one of the most-requested features for Loki, and we’re happy to announce that in the upcoming v2.4 release, the requirement to have log lines arrive in order by timestamp will be lifted. Simple configuration will allow out-of-order writes for Loki v2.4. If you’re using Grafana Cloud, our fully managed platform integrating metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards, out-of-order writes are already accepted.
The restriction and its effects
From Loki’s inception as a memory-efficient log aggregation tool, it has required that log entries within a stream arrive in time order. Log entries written to Loki in violation …</span>

                    <span>This
ars technica article describes a problem with the Travis
continuous-integration service:


	A security flaw in Travis CI potentially exposed the secrets of
	thousands of open source projects that rely on the hosted
	continuous integration service. Travis CI is a software-testing
	solution used by over 900,000 open source projects and 600,000
	users. A vulnerability in the tool made it possible for secure
	environment variables—signing keys, access credentials, and API
	tokens of all public open source projects—to be exfiltrated.


Any project storing secrets in this service would be well advised to
replace them.</span>

September 13.  Organizer Miguel Ojeda used the opening session to give
an overview of why there is interest in using Rust in the kernel, where the
challenges are, and what the current status is.  The talk and following
discussion provided a good overview of what is driving this initiative and
where some of the sticking points might be.</span>

                    <span>As usual when the Linux 5.15 merge window began wrapping up, I set out to dive into its performance to see what is in store for this next version of the kernel and whether there was any regressions or other performance changes worth noting. Linux 5.15 overall has been in good shape for the &quot;-rc1&quot; state except noticing that code compilation workloads were taking longer on multiple Linux 5.15-rc1-running systems than Linux 5.14 or prior. Seeing it across multiple systems and a very real-world regression, it was worth bisecting and looking closer so here are the details.</span>

Datadog is a powerful product used by many teams, and we hear a lot from customers about how we should further embrace and support this critical data source — which is why we created the Datadog data source plugin a few years ago. Recently, our community and customers have asked us to provide a deeper interoperability with Datadog, offering an experience that is not limited by the Datadog API rate limits.
So today we are introducing a suite of new capabilities in the plugin:

                    <span>While NVIDIA has been supporting Resizable BAR for a while now with their GeForce RTX 30 series graphics cards, for those exclusively using Linux it remains more of a challenge due to AIB partners generally not releasing any vBIOS updates for ReBAR support that can be easily applied under Linux. But if you do carry out an update -- such as under Windows -- the performance uplift can be worthwhile if using a game that can benefit from the support.</span>

                    <span>Interested in learning about load testing? Join us for our next live webinar, “Intro to load testing with Grafana and k6,” on Sept. 16 at 9:30 PT / 12:30 ET / 16:30 UTC.

		
			
		
	


Observability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them
In this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.
Register now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.</span>

                    <span>DEVOPS WEEKLY
ISSUE #559 - 12th September 2021
A few good hindsight design posts this week, both on API design and on data storage cost control. As with lots of decisions, you can apply some patterns too early, but knowing you’ll need to change later if you succeed is useful to remember.

A good post on the early decisions (in this case around data storage) that can lead to cost control discussions later. You can apply this to other systems as well.

                    <span>Grafana 8 brought with it many exciting new features, including the launch of a new alerting system and the expansion of Grafana’s live and streaming data functionality.
