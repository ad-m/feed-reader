Current location/time zone: I live in Bristol, U.K., which at time of writing is in the UTC+1 time zone. Bristol has been described as “lively yet laid-back” and “one of the most cosmopolitan centers outside London.” I like it because it has an incredibly high density of independent breweries.
What do you do at Grafana Labs? I work on the systems supporting Grafana Cloud, specifically those systems managing the Grafana instances we run for our customers. We also identify opportunities for improvement that arise when running Graf…</span>

omnipresent, computers are something you carry in your pocket, the Unix
wars are about as relevant as the War of 1812, and the term &quot;NIS&quot; doesn&#x27;t
ring a bell.  But, for a certain class of Unix old-timer, NIS has a distinct

suggestion that Fedora might drop support for NIS has proved to be a bit of

Software Freedom Conservancy is proud to announce that its efforts to
stand up for the rights of FOSS developers have been successful and that
it has been granted almost all of the exemptions that it requested in
the Librarian of Congress&#x27; recent rule making, according to the final
rule Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection
Systems for Access Control Technologies, which was published today.
Effective today, the Librarian of Congress (&quot;LoC&quot;) granted DMCA
exemptions for installing alternate firmwares on routers and for
investigating copyleft compliance, and the exemption that Software
Freedom Conservancy previously applied for and received on Smart TVs was
also expanded. While our formal request to extend the security research
exemption to include privacy research was not granted, the Register
clarified that privacy research is indeed included in security research.
Our executive director, Karen Sandler, also participated as an
individual in a request to expand the existing exemption for medical
devices which was also successful.</span>

their business on the internet is, sadly, a major goal for advertisers and
others today.  Web browser cookies provide a fairly well-known avenue
for tracking users as they traverse various web sites, but mobile apps are
not browsers, so that mechanism is not available.  As it turns out, though,
there are ways 
to &quot;fingerprint&quot; Android devices—and likely those of other mobile
platforms—so that the device owners can be tracked as they hop

In addition to the great programming we outlined in our initial announcement, we’re delighted to announce four exciting new sessions we’ve added to this year’s agenda, featuring speakers from Unity, TomTom, TripAdvisor, Snyk, Citibank, and Ocrolus.

                    <span>The 5.15-rc7 kernel prepatch is out, rather
later than would have normally been expected due to Linus&#x27;s travel schedule.


	But please do give it a good testing to make sure we&#x27;ve shaken out
	any issues. I have yet more travel coming up next week, so it would
	be very convenient for me to delay the merge window if I get the
	excuse to do so, but right now that looks unlikely.</span>

                    <span>Memory management is a balancing act in a number of ways.  The kernel must
balance the needs of current users of memory with anticipated future needs,
for example.  The kernel must 
also balance the act of reclaiming memory for other uses, which can involve
writing data to permanent storage, with the rate of data that the
underlying storage devices are able to accept.  For years, the
memory-management subsystem has used storage-device congestion as a signal
that it should slow down reclaim.  Unfortunately, that mechanism, which was
a bit questionable from the beginning, has not worked in a long time.  Mel
Gorman is now trying to fix this problem with a
patch set that moves the kernel away from the idea of waiting on congestion.</span>

                    <span>At the end of June, Grafana Labs hosted our first company-wide hackathon: a week where Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. 
The final projects ranged from a live stocks and crypto monitoring platform (which was named the overall winner and dubbed the Best Pitch) to a feature that allows Grafana users within an organization to share recordings of your favorite dashboards, panels, and interactions. 
The trio known as The Alchemists took home the prize for Best Integration/Plugin. Here’s a look at how their project came together.

                    <span>NB: This blog post is written with my Prometheus hat on.
Prometheus is the industry standard in cloud native metric monitoring with hundreds of thousands of installations, millions of users, and billions in market value.
Speaking as a member of the Prometheus team, we have seen the project become a victim of its own success. While most people may be using Prometheus, not everybody is following the same operating standards. Over the years, we’ve seen again and again that there is a ton of informal knowledge among projects and vendors about who is actually compatible with Prometheus and who might not be, but there is strong reluctance to engage in a public dispute. The result is that we have confusion in the user base about who is actually doing things the Prometheus way and who is just clai…</span>

                    <span>Here at Grafana Labs, when we’re building integrations for Grafana Cloud, we’re often thinking about how to help users get started on their observability journeys. We like to focus some of our attention on the different technologies you might come across along the way. That way, we can share our tips on the best ways to interact with them while you’re using Grafana products.
In this post, I’m going to focus on the open-source, distributed storage system Ceph, our latest integration available in Grafana Cloud (including the forever-free tier).
The basics
Ceph implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, then provides 3-in-1 interfaces for object, block, and file-level storage. The goal is to offer a completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, w…</span>

                    <span>Are you running Kubernetes? Are you overwhelmed by the amount of telemetry you are gathering? Are you not yet gathering anything at all? 
Whether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. 
For some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.

		
			
		
	


In this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. 
The Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. 
We hope you’ll join us!
Grafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case. Sign up for free now!</span>

ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021
Seeing all of the tweets from KubeCon this week really made me miss seeing everyone in person. Devops to me has been all about the community, and while that still exists in virtual form, it’s always been one of my favourite things to meet up with, and talk to, people in this community in real life..

                    <span>What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder &amp; CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here&#x27;s Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.

Sorry for the long gap in posting, but I’ve been building a new app. I’m looking for testers for my new iOS fitness app: Max reHIT Workout. It guides you through proven ​​reduced-exertion high-intensity interval workouts. If that interests you, please give it a try through TestFlight. I’d appreciate any feedback and suggestions for improvement. Thanks!
