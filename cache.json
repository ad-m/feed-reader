Because distributions set up disk\n\tencryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an\n\tattacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute\n\tforce your password. What's worse: since code authentication ends\n\tat the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,\n\tbackdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd\n\tany way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.\n\n\nThe article contains a lot of suggestions for how to do things better.",

One interesting use case is correlating sales data to system metrics and logs, which would be valuable if your company uses any software systems at all to help generate revenue.\nWhen we think of observing systems, no matter how complex they get, we are ultimately trying to maximize one of two levers: increase revenue or decrease costs.

Observability is the practice of taking an opaque system, or action in a system, and making it available for us to inspect and reason about through its outputs.\nFor instance, consider an interaction from a user that results in an order being placed through the orders API.
