          "description": "What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.\n\r\nSearch engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.\n\r\nUntil now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.\n\r\n1. Anatomy of an index",

The results of this year’s elections are now available, and I am glad to share that I have been elected to serve on the board!\nI’m thankful for every one of the votes I got and I am honored to work with the members of the board. I believe that the results of this election reflect my contributions to the community over the past few years, including code contributions, speaking engagements, blog posts, and supporting users.\nIt is also a reflection of the commitment Grafana Labs has to investing in OpenTelemetry. I wouldn’t have been a candidate without the company’s support and without the freedom to dedicate official working hours to this endeavor.\nGrafana Labs’ interest in OpenTelemetry is not new: We have been supporting OTLP as a possible input protocol for Grafana Tempo since its inception, and our Grafana Agent embeds parts of the OpenTelemetry Collector.\nAs a member of the board, my goals align with the platform I submitted for the election:\nCommunity: Ensure that OpenTelemetry’s decisions continue to be compatible with the interests of the broader open source observability ecosystem, including users, developers, projects, and vendors.\nDiversity: Create new and strengthen existing diversity initiatives, like Outreachy, across OpenTelemetry’s SIGs and projects.\nI’m looking forward to collaborating with the members of the board for the next two years!\nAre you interested in joining Grafana Labs?
