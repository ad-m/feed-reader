This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development\n\tperspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is\n\tproblematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and\n\tso we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an\n\tentire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our\n\tsolution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at\n\tthe latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,\n\tthat version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will\n\teventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.

Join us for our next live webinar, “Intro to load testing with Grafana and k6,” on Sept. 16 at 9:30 PT / 12:30 ET / 16:30 UTC.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nObservability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them\nIn this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.\nRegister now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.",

This not only lowers load times for popular dashboards, but will also reduce API costs for your data sources and decrease the likelihood that those APIs will rate-limit or throttle requests. \nHere’s one common scenario in which query caching can have a great impact on organizations.
