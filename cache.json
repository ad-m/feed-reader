          "description": "Over at the SAMBA+ blog, the performance of the new ksmbd kernel SMB server and Samba in user space are compared:\n\nksmbd claims performance improvements on a wide range of benchmarks: the graphs on this page show a doubling of performance on some tests. There was also the notion that an in-kernel server is likely an easier place to support SMB Direct, which uses RDMA to transfer data between systems.\n\nClearly, those number are impressive, but at the same time recent improvements in Samba's IO performance put this into perspective: by leveraging the new \"io_uring\" Linux API Samba is able to provide roughly 10x the throughput compared to ksmbd.\n\nTime will tell whether it's better to reside in kernel-space like ksmbd or in user-space like Samba in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the available hardware.\n\n\nThere are two graphs that show some impressive results for Samba.",

          "description": "HashiCorp Vault is an increasingly popular multi-cloud security tool that allows users to authenticate and access different clouds, systems, and endpoints, and centrally store, access, and deploy secrets. At Grafana Labs, we’re always looking for ways to make it easy for our community to get started monitoring important parts of their systems. So we’re happy to share some new integrations that will help our users get the most out of Grafana + Vault.\nMetrics and logs streaming from Vault Cloud to Grafana Cloud\nWith this new integration, it’s easier than ever to get your Vault Cloud metrics and logs into Grafana Cloud, our fully managed observability platform, so you can monitor Vault Cloud natively.\nPreviously, the process was largely manual, requiring users to set up metrics and log collec…",

          "description": "I joined Grafana Labs as a software engineer in October to help build out a team focused on OpenTelemetry, and within a few weeks, I was promptly encouraged to run for a seat on the OpenTelemetry board.\nEvery year, the OpenTelemetry community holds elections for a few seats on the Governance Committee board, which oversees the project at large. The results of this year’s elections are now available, and I am glad to share that I have been elected to serve on the board!\nI’m thankful for every one of the votes I got and I am honored to work with the members of the board. I believe that the results of this election reflect my contributions to the community over the past few years, including code contributions, speaking engagements, blog posts, and supporting users.\nIt is also a reflection of the commitment Grafana Labs has to investing in OpenTelemetry. I wouldn’t have been a candidate without the company’s support and without the freedom to dedicate official working hours to this endeavor.\nGrafana Labs’ interest in OpenTelemetry is not new: We have been supporting OTLP as a possible input protocol for Grafana Tempo since its inception, and our Grafana Agent embeds parts of the OpenTelemetry Collector.\nAs a member of the board, my goals align with the platform I submitted for the election:\nCommunity: Ensure that OpenTelemetry’s decisions continue to be compatible with the interests of the broader open source observability ecosystem, including users, developers, projects, and vendors.\nDiversity: Create new and strengthen existing diversity initiatives, like Outreachy, across OpenTelemetry’s SIGs and projects.\nI’m looking forward to collaborating with the members of the board for the next two years!\nAre you interested in joining Grafana Labs? Come work with me and other Grafanistas on OpenTelemetry and other parts of the observability ecosystem!",
