Because distributions set up disk\n\tencryption the way they do, and only bind it to a user password, an\n\tattacker can easily duplicate the disk, and then attempt to brute\n\tforce your password. What's worse: since code authentication ends\n\tat the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,\n\tbackdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd\n\tany way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.\n\n\nThe article contains a lot of suggestions for how to do things better.",

Building from source in a user-verifiable manner is part of the philosophy behind Guix, but there were a number of problems that were encountered:\n\nThe first surprise when starting packaging PyTorch is that, despite being on PyPI, PyTorch is first and foremost a large C++ code base. It does have a setup.py as commonly found in pure Python packages, but that file delegates the bulk of the work to CMake.\n\nThe second surprise is that PyTorch bundles (or \"vendors\", as some would say) source code for no less than 41 dependencies, ranging from small Python and C++ helper libraries to large C++ neural network tools. Like other distributions such as Debian, Guix avoids bundling: we would rather have one Guix package for each of these dependencies. The rationale is manifold, but it boils down to keeping things auditable, reducing resource usage, and making security updates practical.",

Allowing out-of-order writes has been one of the most-requested features for Loki, and we’re happy to announce that in the upcoming v2.4 release, the requirement to have log lines arrive in order by timestamp will be lifted. Simple configuration will allow out-of-order writes for Loki v2.4. If you’re using Grafana Cloud, our fully managed platform integrating metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards, out-of-order writes are already accepted.\nThe restriction and its effects\nFrom Loki’s inception as a memory-efficient log aggregation tool, it has required that log entries within a stream arrive in time order.

Join us for our next live webinar, “Intro to load testing with Grafana and k6,” on Sept. 16 at 9:30 PT / 12:30 ET / 16:30 UTC.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nObservability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them\nIn this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.\nRegister now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.",
