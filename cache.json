An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.\n\nSPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.",

Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them\nIn this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.\nRegister now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.",

          "description": "Over the years, we’ve heard many versions of the same familiar story: large businesses struggling with observability data living in several different systems. At Grafana Labs, our “big tent” philosophy is based on the belief that our users should determine their own observability strategy and choose their own tools. Grafana allows them to bring together and understand all their data, no matter where it lives. \nRecently, there’s been interest in our community in Honeycomb, an observability tool focused on debugging high-cardinality and high-dimensionality data. One of our customers in particular wanted to use Honeycomb Query Data, now accessible with a new API, to monitor application performance in conjunction with other observability tools and Grafana features such as annotations.

          "description": "Grafana Tempo 1.1 has been released, and like our major version suggests, there are no breaking changes. If you’d like, please check out the release notes. But if you find that release notes can sometimes be difficult to decode, fret not! All the highlights are below.\nFeatures\nThere are a number of features and enhancements detailed in the docs, but here are a few you should be paying attention to if you are running a high-volume Tempo cluster.\nHedged requests\nFirst, hedged requests allow you to retry a request to your backend a second time when it exceeds a configurable threshold. If this threshold is set to your backend’s p99, then Tempo will retry the slowest 1% of all backend requests. This can have an amazing impact on Tempo’s overall long tail:\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nAs this graph shows, p99…",
