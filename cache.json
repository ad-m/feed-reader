SPDX has been used in the kernel and other projects to identify the licenses and attach other metadata to  software components.\n\nBetween eighty and ninety percent (80%-90%) of a modern application is assembled from open source software components. An SBOM [software bill of materials] accounts for the software components contained in an application — open source, proprietary, or third-party — and details their provenance, license, and security attributes. SBOMs are used as a part of a foundational practice to track and trace components across software supply chains. SBOMs also help to proactively identify software issues and risks and establish a starting point for their remediation.\n\nSPDX results from ten years of collaboration from representatives across industries, including the leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) vendors – making it the most robust, mature, and adopted SBOM standard.",

This enables observability teams to run one GEM cluster to support multiple teams, but give each team the experience of having a dedicated metrics database.
