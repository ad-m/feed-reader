See\nthis\nGitHub blog post for a look at some of the more significant changes in\nthis release:\n\n\n\tort does just that: it’s a full-blown rewrite of the merge strategy\n\tthat aims to emulate the same concepts behind recursive while\n\tavoiding many of its long-standing performance and correctness\n\tproblems. In a merge containing many renames, ort outperforms\n\trecursive by 500x. For a series of similar merges (like in a rebase\n\toperation), the speedup is over 9000x, in part due to ort's ability to cache and reuse\n\tresults from previous merges.",
