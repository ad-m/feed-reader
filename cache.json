There are few surprises here, but the picture is still\ndiscouraging.\n\n\n\tWe find that the Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei and Realme Android\n\tvariants all transmit a substantial volume of data to the OS\n\tdeveloper (i.e. Samsung etc) and to third-party parties that have\n\tpre-installed system apps (including Google, Microsoft, Heytap,\n\tLinkedIn, Facebook). LineageOS sends similar volumes of data to\n\tGoogle as these proprietary Android variants, but we do not observe\n\tthe LineageOS developers themselves collecting data nor\n\tpre-installed system apps other than those of Google.

Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.\n\r\nSearch engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.\n\r\nUntil now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.\n\r\n1. Anatomy of an index",

After moving to the manager track, I thought it was a great opportunity to do some coding between meetings. Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative. And finally, I wanted to set an example for my team. When it comes to personal development or finding personal projects, I regularly encourage the team to take a break from Business As Usual (BAU)…",

The idea of thoroughly reviewing a product before handing over the pager is a really good one, but except for Google-scale companies, there aren’t that many organizations that can afford dedicated SRE teams.\nAt Grafana Labs, our product teams often take the role of the SRE teams. Moreover, due to a lot of technical similarities, we have an on-call rotation that’s responsible for multiple products — staffed with engineers from different product teams. Since there’s no official SRE onboarding, we’ve built production readiness review as a completely separate process that strives to add value by having the product in …",

Be sure to sign up for our two upcoming live webinars, which have been scheduled at EMEA- and APAC-friendly times. We know we have community members all over the globe, and we’re excited to be able to present these webinars at different times so that more people can participate in the live sessions and Q&A.\nGetting started with Loki (EMEA)\nThursday, October 21, at 10:00 CET / 08:00 UTC\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nIn this webinar you’ll hear about the key benefits of Loki and get a live demo of the new set of query language features that lets you extract more labels at query time to allow for query possibilities only limited by your imagination! You’ll also learn how to create metrics from logs and alert on your logs with powerful Prometheus-style alerting rules.\nRegister here for the webinar.\nManaging privacy in log data with Grafana Loki (APAC)\nWednesday, October 20 at 13:00 AET, 03:00 UTC\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nLaws for data privacy are complex and rapidly changing. Organizations can struggle to understand their responsibilities, implement the correct privacy strategy, and define which data must be part of it. Regulations such GDPR or CCPA consider log aggregation platforms as data stores, so they need to be included in readiness assessments. During this webinar, we will see how Grafana Loki can help organizations meet these requirements.\nRegister here for the webinar.",
