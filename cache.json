What's worse: since code authentication ends\n\tat the kernel — and the initrd is not authenticated anymore —,\n\tbackdooring is trivially easy: an attacker can change the initrd\n\tany way they want, without having to fight any kind of protections.\n\n\nThe article contains a lot of suggestions for how to do things better.",

          "description": "Good news for Salesforce users: With the new Salesforce plugin for Grafana, available now with an Enterprise license, you can instantly visualize your SFDC data in Grafana dashboards.\nPlus, Grafana allows you to visualize the Salesforce data alongside all sorts of other data. One interesting use case is correlating sales data to system metrics and logs, which would be valuable if your company uses any software systems at all to help generate revenue.\nWhen we think of observing systems, no matter how complex they get, we are ultimately trying to maximize one of two levers: increase revenue or decrease costs. Salesforce is the ultimate tool for describing the revenue pipeline. With the Salesforce plugin for Grafana, you can bring observability to your sales pipeline.\nWhy correlate sales data…",

Observability is the practice of taking an opaque system, or action in a system, and making it available for us to inspect and reason about through its outputs.\nFor instance, consider an interaction from a user that results in an order being placed through the orders API. If that order placement goes south, to what degree are we able to debug and troubleshoot that? Are we able to see …",
