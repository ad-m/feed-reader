While the exploitation analysis is highly detailed, more than half of the post looks at various defenses to this kind of bug.\n\n\nThis blog post describes a straightforward Linux kernel locking bug and how I exploited it against Debian Buster's 4.19.0-13-amd64 kernel. Based on that, it explores options for security mitigations that could prevent or hinder exploitation of issues similar to this one.\n\nI hope that stepping through such an exploit and sharing this compiled knowledge with the wider security community can help with reasoning about the relative utility of various mitigation approaches.\n\nA lot of the individual exploitation techniques and mitigation options that I am describing here aren't novel. However, I believe that there is value in writing them up together to show how various mitigations interact with a fairly normal use-after-free exploit.",

She explains that in past litigation, the plaintiffs have always been copyright holders of the specific GPL code. In this case, Software Freedom Conservancy hopes to demonstrate that it's not just the copyright holders, but also the receivers of the licensed code who are entitled to rights.\n\nThe lawsuit suit seeks no monetary damages, but instead seeks access to the technical information that the copyleft licenses require Vizio to provide to all customers who purchase its TVs (specifically, the plaintiff is asking for the technical information via \"specific performance\" rather than \"damages\").\n\n\nThe complaint is also available.",

Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.\n\r\nSearch engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.\n\r\nUntil now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.\n\r\n1. Anatomy of an index",

We like to focus some of our attention on the different technologies you might come across along the way. That way, we can share our tips on the best ways to interact with them while you’re using Grafana products.\nIn this post, I’m going to focus on the open-source, distributed storage system Ceph, our latest integration.\nThe basics\nCeph implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, then provides 3-in-1 interfaces for object, block, and file-level storage. The goal is to offer a completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, which allows you to have availability and the option to scale.…",

Are you not yet gathering anything at all? \nWhether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. \nFor some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nIn this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. \nThe Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. \nWe hope you’ll join us!",

Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative.
