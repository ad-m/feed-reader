And that is\n\twhat I and my team are here for at the end of the day, to make sure\n\tRed Hat customers are able to get their job done using their Linux\n\tsystems.",

          "description": "Ariadne Conill looks\nat the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the\ncontext of Alpine Linux.\n\n\n\tFor distributions, however, the story is different:\n\tcryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to\n\tleverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the\n\tlanguage.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development\n\tperspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is\n\tproblematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and\n\tso we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an\n\tentire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our\n\tsolution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at\n\tthe latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,\n\tthat version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will\n\teventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,\n\tsince cryptography has to move to community, so does\n\tparamiko and Ansible.",

Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them\nIn this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.\nRegister now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.",
