          "description": "At the end of June, we held our first company-wide hackathon: a week for Grafanistas to unlock their creativity and think outside the box (but often within a panel).\n“We have an incredibly talented team here at Grafana Labs, and so many of our most valuable features (not to mention entire projects) have come from grassroots innovation rather than top-down planning,” our CEO, Raj Dutt, said during the kickoff.  “I really want to accelerate and amplify that as we scale.”\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nDuring the hackathon, Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. Normal schedules and deliverables were pushed back a week, so that participants could focus on their hackathon projects.\nA total of 125 people participated — more than a quarter of the company at the time. Many of the 49 teams were boldly cross-functional, combining sales with engineering and IT, product marketing with solutions engineering, UX with R&D.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\nWe were thrilled with the overwhelmingly positive response to the hackathon, not just from participants, but also from the entire staff, who watched presentations from the five finalist teams during an all-hands meeting and voted for the overall winner. (A panel of judges also gave out some awards in different categories.)\nSo over the next few weeks, we’ll showcase on the blog the cool projects the teams built, and equally importantly, the behind-the-scenes fun they had, often working with folks they hadn’t collaborated with before. The best part of the hackathon was “seeing so much get done in so little time,” says Senior Software Engineer Yas Ekinci, “and meeting Grafanistas across the globe.”",

          "description": "Not so long ago, development teams working for the U.S. Department of Defense could take anywhere from three to ten years to deliver software. “It was mostly teams using waterfall, no minimum viable product, no incremental delivery, and no feedback loop from end users,” Nicolas M. Chaillan, Chief Software Officer of the U.S. Air Force, said in a CNCF case study. “Particularly when it comes to AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, everyone realized we have to move faster.”\nSo in 2018, the DoD launched the Enterprise DevSecOps Initiative to modernize DoD software development in order to deliver secure, resilient applications “at the speed of relevance.” The initiative included a mandate to use Kubernetes container orchestration and other open source technologies and the establishment of Iron Bank, a rigorously vetted repository of digitally signed, hardened container images for best-of-breed development tools and software capabilities.\nToday, we’re pleased to announce that Grafana, Grafana Enterprise, and Grafana Loki have received formal authorization from Iron Bank, which allows the 100,000 employees and contractors working on Department of Defense software, both classified and unclassified, to easily select and immediately deploy our software without additional approvals and security certifications. Prometheus, the CNCF monitoring project that Grafana Labs heavily contributes to, has also been authorized by Iron Bank.\n“DoD teams need the best tools to build critical applications better and faster,” said Chaillan. “Grafana is a critical option for our developers as a unique visualization and dashboarding capability. Its interoperability with a multitude of data sources is crucial for the DoD; we’re one of the largest organizations on the planet, and we know that one size doesn’t fit all. Iron Bank authorization for Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki gives our teams instant access to powerful observability tools that are essential for keeping DoD software running reliably and having the right insights.”",

          "description": "Good news for Salesforce users: With the new Salesforce plugin for Grafana, available now with an Enterprise license, you can instantly visualize your SFDC data in Grafana dashboards.\nPlus, Grafana allows you to visualize the Salesforce data alongside all sorts of other data. One interesting use case is correlating sales data to system metrics and logs, which would be valuable if your company uses any software systems at all to help generate revenue.\nWhen we think of observing systems, no matter how complex they get, we are ultimately trying to maximize one of two levers: increase revenue or decrease costs. Salesforce is the ultimate tool for describing the revenue pipeline. With the Salesforce plugin for Grafana, you can bring observability to your sales pipeline.\nWhy correlate sales data…",

          "description": "One of the experiences I’ve truly enjoyed over my first year as a senior solutions engineer here at Grafana Labs has been learning from our community and customers about their own Grafana journeys. I’ve been impressed by some remarkable dashboards for home automation, personal health data visualizations, family Minecraft statistics, and energy usage projects. At the same time, I’ve seen network performance management teams share their delight with Grafana Enterprise Metrics, and operation teams appreciating how quickly they can ingest and search through petabytes of real-time logging with Grafana Enterprise Logs. Everybody has a personal observability story, and here is one of mine…\nAt the start of this year, I discovered WeatherFlow Tempest, a wireless, solar-powered, all-in-one, IoT smar…",

          "description": "I’ve spent most of my career working with tech in various forms, and for the last ten years or so, I’ve focused a lot on building, maintaining, and operating robust, reliable systems.\nThis has led me to put a lot of time into researching, evaluating, and implementing different solutions for automatic failure detection, monitoring, and more recently, observability.\nBefore we get started: What is observability? Observability is the practice of taking an opaque system, or action in a system, and making it available for us to inspect and reason about through its outputs.\nFor instance, consider an interaction from a user that results in an order being placed through the orders API. If that order placement goes south, to what degree are we able to debug and troubleshoot that? Are we able to see …",

Pretty close to every one of those requests is authenticated using the AWS SIGv4 protocol, before IAM authorization policy is applied to check if the request is allowed or not. \nI didn’t have a hand in designing the AWS SIGv4 protocol so hopefully it’s not too biased to say that I dearly love how AWS SIGv4 works. SIGv4 rigorously authenticates every request individually and it’s reassuringly simple. It uses fast cryptography based on the HMAC algorithm to strongly authenticate every request. Customer’s secrets never appear in these requests directly, and there are neat properties built in that mean every request is finely scoped down and signed with a token…",
