maintainable over the long term.  One of those is software complexity.  At
the recently concluded 2021 KVM
Forum, Paolo Bonzini
explored
this topic, using QEMU, the open source emulator
and virtualizer, as a case study.  Drawing on his experience as
a maintainer of several QEMU subsystems, he made some concrete
suggestions on how to defend against undesirable complexity.  Bonzini
used QEMU as a running example throughout the talk, hoping to make it
easier for future contributors to modify QEMU.  However, the
lessons he shared are equally applicable to many other projects.]]></summary>

	variants all transmit a substantial volume of data to the OS
	developer (i.e. Samsung etc) and to third-party parties that have
	pre-installed system apps (including Google, Microsoft, Heytap,
	LinkedIn, Facebook). LineageOS sends similar volumes of data to
	Google as these proprietary Android variants, but we do not observe
	the LineageOS developers themselves collecting data nor
	pre-installed system apps other than those of Google. Notably,
	/e/OS sends no information to Google or other third parties and
	sends essentially no information to the /e/OS developers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grafana 8.2 was released last week, and we’re excited to announce one of its new features: contact point testing. Now users of Grafana 8 alerting can test their contact points right from the contact points page. This feature makes it easier to configure Grafana 8 alerting and gives you the confidence in knowing that your contact points are working as expected before they fire.
Here are the basics:
What are contact points?
Contact points contain configuration for zero or more contact point types (i.e. email, Slack, webhook, etc.) that receive notifications when an alert is firing. A contact point is not limited to just one contact point type and can have multiple contact point types.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.

concept to the memory-management subsystem appears to be stalled, but appearances can
be deceiving.  The numerous folio discussions have produced a number of

kernel has to work with page structures to get its job done.  As
an example of how a subsystem might be weaned off of struct page
usage, Matthew Wilcox has split out
the slab allocators in a 62-part patch set.  The result may be
a foreshadowing of changes to come in the memory-management subsystem.]]></summary>

is a bit surprising, given that Linux has benefited greatly from the
user-space Samba solution since
shortly after the
beginning.  There are reasons for this move but, in the short term at
least, they risk being overshadowed by a worrisome stream of

All Grafana Cloud instances have been protected since 2021-09-16, and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. Grafana Enterprise customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo on 2021-09-28.
8.1.5 contained a single fix for bar chart panels. We believe that users can expedite deployment by moving from 8.1.4 to 8.1.6 directly.

Be sure to sign up for our two upcoming live webinars, which have been scheduled at EMEA- and APAC-friendly times. We know we have community members all over the globe, and we’re excited to be able to present these webinars at different times so that more people can participate in the live sessions and Q&A.
Getting started with Loki (EMEA)
Thursday, October 21, at 10:00 CET / 08:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


In this webinar you’ll hear about the key benefits of Loki and get a live demo of the new set of query language features that lets you extract more labels at query time to allow for query possibilities only limited by your imagination! You’ll also learn how to create metrics from logs and alert on your logs with powerful Prometheus-style alerting rules.
Register here for the webinar.
Managing privacy in log data with Grafana Loki (APAC)
Wednesday, October 20 at 13:00 AET, 03:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


Laws for data privacy are complex and rapidly changing. Organizations can struggle to understand their responsibilities, implement the correct privacy strategy, and define which data must be part of it. Regulations such GDPR or CCPA consider log aggregation platforms as data stores, so they need to be included in readiness assessments. During this webinar, we will see how Grafana Loki can help organizations meet these requirements.

        <updated>2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of June, we held our first company-wide hackathon: a week for Grafanistas to unlock their creativity and think outside the box (but often within a panel).
“We have an incredibly talented team here at Grafana Labs, and so many of our most valuable features (not to mention entire projects) have come from grassroots innovation rather than top-down planning,” our CEO, Raj Dutt, said during the kickoff.  “I really want to accelerate and amplify that as we scale.”

		
			
		
	


During the hackathon, Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. Normal schedules and deliverables were pushed back a week, so that participants could focus on their hackathon projects.
A total of 125 people participated — more than a quarter of the company at the time. Many of the 49 teams were boldly cross-functional, combining sales with engineering and IT, product marketing with solutions engineering, UX with R&D.

		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	


We were thrilled with the overwhelmingly positive response to the hackathon, not just from participants, but also from the entire staff, who watched presentations from the five finalist teams during an all-hands meeting and voted for the overall winner. (A panel of judges also gave out some awards in different categories.)
So over the next few weeks, we’ll showcase on the blog the cool projects the teams built, and equally importantly, the behind-the-scenes fun they had, often working with folks they hadn’t collaborated with before. The best part of the hackathon was “seeing so much get done in so little time,” says Senior Software Engineer Yas Ekinci, “and meeting Grafanistas across the globe.”]]></summary>

        <link href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/09/29/the-u.s.-department-of-defense-formally-authorizes-grafana-grafana-enterprise-and-loki-for-its-100000-developers/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not so long ago, development teams working for the U.S. Department of Defense could take anywhere from three to ten years to deliver software. “It was mostly teams using waterfall, no minimum viable product, no incremental delivery, and no feedback loop from end users,” Nicolas M. Chaillan, Chief Software Officer of the U.S. Air Force, said in a CNCF case study. “Particularly when it comes to AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, everyone realized we have to move faster.”
So in 2018, the DoD launched the Enterprise DevSecOps Initiative to modernize DoD software development in order to deliver secure, resilient applications “at the speed of relevance.” The initiative included a mandate to use Kubernetes container orchestration and other open source technologies and the establishment of Iron Bank, a rigorously vetted repository of digitally signed, hardened container images for best-of-breed development tools and software capabilities.
Today, we’re pleased to announce that Grafana, Grafana Enterprise, and Grafana Loki have received formal authorization from Iron Bank, which allows the 100,000 employees and contractors working on Department of Defense software, both classified and unclassified, to easily select and immediately deploy our software without additional approvals and security certifications. Prometheus, the CNCF monitoring project that Grafana Labs heavily contributes to, has also been authorized by Iron Bank.
“DoD teams need the best tools to build critical applications better and faster,” said Chaillan. “Grafana is a critical option for our developers as a unique visualization and dashboarding capability. Its interoperability with a multitude of data sources is crucial for the DoD; we’re one of the largest organizations on the planet, and we know that one size doesn’t fit all. Iron Bank authorization for Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki gives our teams instant access to powerful observability tools that are essential for keeping DoD software running reliably and having the right insights.”]]></summary>
