        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Julia programming language has
its roots in high-performance scientific computing, so it is no surprise
that it has facilities for concurrent processing. Those features are not
well-known outside of the Julia community, though, so it is interesting to
see the different types of parallel and concurrent computation that the
language supports. In addition, the upcoming release of Julia
version 1.7 brings an improvement to the language's
concurrent-computation palette, 
in the form of "task 
migration".]]></summary>

the "local email interface" (lei) functionality for the lore archive of

	Even though it started out as merely a list archival service, it
	quickly became obvious that lore could be used for a lot more. Many

of block-layer optimizations that enabled a suitably equipped system to
sustain 3.5 million I/O operations per second (IOPS).  That
optimization work has continued since then, and those 3.5 million IOPS
would be a deeply disappointing result now.  A recent disagreement over the
addition of a new feature has highlighted the potential cost of a heavily
optimized block layer, though; when is a feature deemed important enough to
outweigh the drive for maximum performance?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the SAMBA+ blog, the performance of the new ksmbd kernel SMB server and Samba in user space are compared:

ksmbd claims performance improvements on a wide range of benchmarks: the graphs on this page show a doubling of performance on some tests. There was also the notion that an in-kernel server is likely an easier place to support SMB Direct, which uses RDMA to transfer data between systems.

Clearly, those number are impressive, but at the same time recent improvements in Samba's IO performance put this into perspective: by leveraging the new "io_uring" Linux API Samba is able to provide roughly 10x the throughput compared to ksmbd.

Time will tell whether it's better to reside in kernel-space like ksmbd or in user-space like Samba in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the available hardware.


There are two graphs that show some impressive results for Samba.]]></summary>

	Well, __libc_start_main calls __libc_init_first,

	argument vector and then sets a global variable __environ
	which __libc_start_main uses thereafter whenever it needs
	it including when it calls main. After the envp
	is established, then __libc_start_main uses the same trick
	and surprise! Just past the terminating null at the end of the
	envp array, there's another vector, the ELF auxiliary
	vector the loader uses to pass some information to the process. An

At Grafana Labs, we’re always looking for ways to make it easy for our community to get started monitoring important parts of their systems. So we’re happy to share some new integrations that will help our users get the most out of Grafana + Vault.
Metrics and logs streaming from Vault Cloud to Grafana Cloud
With this new integration, it’s easier than ever to get your Vault Cloud metrics and logs into Grafana Cloud, our fully managed observability platform, so you can monitor Vault Cloud natively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined Grafana Labs as a software engineer in October to help build out a team focused on OpenTelemetry, and within a few weeks, I was promptly encouraged to run for a seat on the OpenTelemetry board.
Every year, the OpenTelemetry community holds elections for a few seats on the Governance Committee board, which oversees the project at large. The results of this year’s elections are now available, and I am glad to share that I have been elected to serve on the board!
I’m thankful for every one of the votes I got and I am honored to work with the members of the board. I believe that the results of this election reflect my contributions to the community over the past few years, including code contributions, speaking engagements, blog posts, and supporting users.
It is also a reflection of the commitment Grafana Labs has to investing in OpenTelemetry. I wouldn’t have been a candidate without the company’s support and without the freedom to dedicate official working hours to this endeavor.
Grafana Labs’ interest in OpenTelemetry is not new: We have been supporting OTLP as a possible input protocol for Grafana Tempo since its inception, and our Grafana Agent embeds parts of the OpenTelemetry Collector.
As a member of the board, my goals align with the platform I submitted for the election:
Community: Ensure that OpenTelemetry’s decisions continue to be compatible with the interests of the broader open source observability ecosystem, including users, developers, projects, and vendors.
Diversity: Create new and strengthen existing diversity initiatives, like Outreachy, across OpenTelemetry’s SIGs and projects.
I’m looking forward to collaborating with the members of the board for the next two years!
Are you interested in joining Grafana Labs? Come work with me and other Grafanistas on OpenTelemetry and other parts of the observability ecosystem!]]></summary>

Current location/time zone: I live in Bristol, U.K., which at time of writing is in the UTC+1 time zone. Bristol has been described as “lively yet laid-back” and “one of the most cosmopolitan centers outside London.” I like it because it has an incredibly high density of independent breweries.
