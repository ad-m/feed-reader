        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many new features pulled into the mainline during the 5.15 merge
window is the ksmbd
network filesystem server.  Ksmbd implements the SMB protocol
(also known as CIFS, though that name has gone out of favor) that is
heavily used in the Windows world.  The creation of an in-kernel SMB server
is a bit surprising, given that Linux has benefited greatly from the
user-space Samba solution since
shortly after the
beginning.  There are reasons for this move but, in the short term at
least, they risk being overshadowed by a worrisome stream of
security-related problems in ksmbd.]]></summary>

presentation at
Open
Source Summit North America 2021 on a proposal for a different way to
handle the stable tree.   He noted that throughout most of the kernel's history,
version numbers did not really mean anything, but that the versioning
scheme suggests that they do, which leads to a disconnect between how the
kernels are seen versus how they are actually maintained.  He proposed
making a "rolling stable" release that 
provides users what they need—timely fixes to their kernel—without forcing
them to choose to switch to a new version number.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interested in learning more about Grafana Loki, our open source logging aggregation solution inspired by Prometheus? Be sure to sign up for our two upcoming live webinars, which have been scheduled at EMEA- and APAC-friendly times. We know we have community members all over the globe, and we’re excited to be able to present these webinars at different times so that more people can participate in the live sessions and Q&A.
Getting started with Loki (EMEA)
Thursday, October 21, at 10:00 CET / 08:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


In this webinar you’ll hear about the key benefits of Loki and get a live demo of the new set of query language features that lets you extract more labels at query time to allow for query possibilities only limited by your imagination! You’ll also learn how to create metrics from logs and alert on your logs with powerful Prometheus-style alerting rules.
Register here for the webinar.
Managing privacy in log data with Grafana Loki (APAC)
Wednesday, October 20 at 13:00 AET, 03:00 UTC

		
			
		
	


Laws for data privacy are complex and rapidly changing. Organizations can struggle to understand their responsibilities, implement the correct privacy strategy, and define which data must be part of it. Regulations such GDPR or CCPA consider log aggregation platforms as data stores, so they need to be included in readiness assessments. During this webinar, we will see how Grafana Loki can help organizations meet these requirements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of June, we held our first company-wide hackathon: a week for Grafanistas to unlock their creativity and think outside the box (but often within a panel).
“We have an incredibly talented team here at Grafana Labs, and so many of our most valuable features (not to mention entire projects) have come from grassroots innovation rather than top-down planning,” our CEO, Raj Dutt, said during the kickoff.  “I really want to accelerate and amplify that as we scale.”

		
			
		
	


During the hackathon, Grafanistas from all over the org joined forces to invent, build, and solve challenging technical problems related to our products, community, and business. Normal schedules and deliverables were pushed back a week, so that participants could focus on their hackathon projects.
A total of 125 people participated — more than a quarter of the company at the time. Many of the 49 teams were boldly cross-functional, combining sales with engineering and IT, product marketing with solutions engineering, UX with R&D.

		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	

















	
		
			
		
	


We were thrilled with the overwhelmingly positive response to the hackathon, not just from participants, but also from the entire staff, who watched presentations from the five finalist teams during an all-hands meeting and voted for the overall winner. (A panel of judges also gave out some awards in different categories.)
So over the next few weeks, we’ll showcase on the blog the cool projects the teams built, and equally importantly, the behind-the-scenes fun they had, often working with folks they hadn’t collaborated with before. The best part of the hackathon was “seeing so much get done in so little time,” says Senior Software Engineer Yas Ekinci, “and meeting Grafanistas across the globe.”]]></summary>

        <updated>2021-09-29T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not so long ago, development teams working for the U.S. Department of Defense could take anywhere from three to ten years to deliver software. “It was mostly teams using waterfall, no minimum viable product, no incremental delivery, and no feedback loop from end users,” Nicolas M. Chaillan, Chief Software Officer of the U.S. Air Force, said in a CNCF case study. “Particularly when it comes to AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, everyone realized we have to move faster.”
So in 2018, the DoD launched the Enterprise DevSecOps Initiative to modernize DoD software development in order to deliver secure, resilient applications “at the speed of relevance.” The initiative included a mandate to use Kubernetes container orchestration and other open source technologies and the establishment of Iron Bank, a rigorously vetted repository of digitally signed, hardened container images for best-of-breed development tools and software capabilities.
Today, we’re pleased to announce that Grafana, Grafana Enterprise, and Grafana Loki have received formal authorization from Iron Bank, which allows the 100,000 employees and contractors working on Department of Defense software, both classified and unclassified, to easily select and immediately deploy our software without additional approvals and security certifications. Prometheus, the CNCF monitoring project that Grafana Labs heavily contributes to, has also been authorized by Iron Bank.
“DoD teams need the best tools to build critical applications better and faster,” said Chaillan. “Grafana is a critical option for our developers as a unique visualization and dashboarding capability. Its interoperability with a multitude of data sources is crucial for the DoD; we’re one of the largest organizations on the planet, and we know that one size doesn’t fit all. Iron Bank authorization for Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki gives our teams instant access to powerful observability tools that are essential for keeping DoD software running reliably and having the right insights.”]]></summary>

When we think of observing systems, no matter how complex they get, we are ultimately trying to maximize one of two levers: increase revenue or decrease costs. Salesforce is the ultimate tool for describing the revenue pipeline. With the Salesforce plugin for Grafana, you can bring observability to your sales pipeline.

This has led me to put a lot of time into researching, evaluating, and implementing different solutions for automatic failure detection, monitoring, and more recently, observability.
Before we get started: What is observability? Observability is the practice of taking an opaque system, or action in a system, and making it available for us to inspect and reason about through its outputs.
For instance, consider an interaction from a user that results in an order being placed through the orders API. If that order placement goes south, to what degree are we able to debug and troubleshoot that? Are we able to see …]]></summary>
