        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new style of GPL-enforcement lawsuit was
filed on October 19 by Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC)
against television maker Vizio.  Unlike previous GPL-enforcement suits, which
have been pursued on behalf of the developers and copyright holders of
GPL-licensed code, this suit has been filed on behalf of owners of the TVs
in question.  The idea that owners of devices that contain code under the
GPL have the right to access that code seems clearly embodied in the
license, but it remains to be seen if the courts will decide that those
owners have the legal standing to sue for relief.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the Project Zero blog, Jann Horn has a lengthy post on a kernel bug, ways to exploit it, and various ideas on mitigation.  While the exploitation analysis is highly detailed, more than half of the post looks at various defenses to this kind of bug.


This blog post describes a straightforward Linux kernel locking bug and how I exploited it against Debian Buster's 4.19.0-13-amd64 kernel. Based on that, it explores options for security mitigations that could prevent or hinder exploitation of issues similar to this one.

I hope that stepping through such an exploit and sharing this compiled knowledge with the wider security community can help with reasoning about the relative utility of various mitigation approaches.

A lot of the individual exploitation techniques and mitigation options that I am describing here aren't novel. However, I believe that there is value in writing them up together to show how various mitigations interact with a fairly normal use-after-free exploit.]]></summary>

The basics
Ceph implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, then provides 3-in-1 interfaces for object, block, and file-level storage. The goal is to offer a completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, which allows you to have availability and the option to scale.…]]></summary>

is a security-oriented desktop operating system that uses multiple virtual
machines (VMs or "qubes") to isolate
various types of functionality.  The idea is to compartmentalize different
applications and operating-system subsystems to protect them from each
other and to limit access to the user's data if an application is
compromised.  Version 4.1 will bring several important enhancements to
help Qubes OS continue to live up to its motto: "A reasonably secure operating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Software Freedom Conservancy has announced that it filed suit against TV maker Vizio over "repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements of the General Public License (GPL)".  The organization raised the problems with Vizio in August 2018, but the company stopped responding in January 2020, according to the announcement. 

"We are asking the court to require Vizio to make good on its obligations under copyleft compliance requirements," says [Software Freedom Conservancy executive director Karen] Sandler. She explains that in past litigation, the plaintiffs have always been copyright holders of the specific GPL code. In this case, Software Freedom Conservancy hopes to demonstrate that it's not just the copyright holders, but also the receivers of the licensed code who are entitled to rights.

The lawsuit suit seeks no monetary damages, but instead seeks access to the technical information that the copyleft licenses require Vizio to provide to all customers who purchase its TVs (specifically, the plaintiff is asking for the technical information via "specific performance" rather than "damages").


The complaint is also available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you running Kubernetes? Are you overwhelmed by the amount of telemetry you are gathering? Are you not yet gathering anything at all? 
Whether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. 
For some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.

		
			
		
	


In this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. 
The Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. 
We hope you’ll join us!]]></summary>

Each Grafana meetup features “bite-sized” presentations from our user community and members of the Grafana Labs team. We want to provide opportunities (even virtually!) for members of our community to connect with one another and share what they’re working on or have learned.
If you’re interested in presenting at a future Grafana Meetup, be sure to fill out our guest speaker application with your talk idea!
With five talks covering a broad spectrum of topics from creating solutions to improve accessibility to bootstrapping multi-DC cloud native stacks, we had a jam-packed agenda for our Grafana EMEA Virtual Meetup.

ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021
Seeing all of the tweets from KubeCon this week really made me miss seeing everyone in person. Devops to me has been all about the community, and while that still exists in virtual form, it’s always been one of my favourite things to meet up with, and talk to, people in this community in real life..

distribution, but the Debian project is far more than that; it is an
ongoing experiment in democratic project governance.  Debian's processes
can result in a lot of public squabbling; one should not lose track,
though, of the fact that those processes have enabled a large community to
maintain and grow a complex distribution for decades without the benefit of
an overseeing corporate overlord.  Processes can be improved, though; a
recent proposal
from Russ Allbery gives an interesting picture of where the pain points
are and what can be made better.]]></summary>

When our first company-wide hackathon was announced in June, I decided to participate for a few reasons. After moving to the manager track, I thought it was a great opportunity to do some coding between meetings. Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative. And finally, I wanted to set an example for my team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest release of the Ubuntu Linux distribution is out: Ubuntu 21.10, code named "Impish Indri".  The release notes fills in all of the details for the new features in this version, but the announcement lists some as well:


Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 makes wayland sessions available while using the 
Nvidia proprietary driver. PulseAudio 15 introduces support for Bluetooth
LDAC and AptX codecs, as well as HFP Bluetooth profiles providing better
audio quality. The recovery key feature at installation time has been
improved, with the recovery key now optional, stronger and editable.
Ubuntu Desktop 21.10 includes GNOME version 40, with a new and
improved Activities Overview design. Workspaces are now arranged
horizontally, and the overview and app grid are accessed vertically.
Each direction has accompanying keyboard shortcuts, touchpad gestures
and mouse actions.

Ubuntu Server 21.10 integrates recent innovations from key open
infrastructure projects like OpenStack Xena, QEMU 6.0, PHP8, libvirt 7.6,
Kubernetes, and Ceph with advanced life-cycle management tools for
multi-cloud and on-prem operations from bare metal, VMWare and
OpenStack, to every major public cloud.]]></summary>

The idea of thoroughly reviewing a product before handing over the pager is a really good one, but except for Google-scale companies, there aren’t that many organizations that can afford dedicated SRE teams.
At Grafana Labs, our product teams often take the role of the SRE teams. Moreover, due to a lot of technical similarities, we have an on-call rotation that’s responsible for multiple products — staffed with engineers from different product teams. Since there’s no official SRE onboarding, we’ve built production readiness review as a completely separate process that strives to add value by having the product in …]]></summary>

Now users of Grafana 8 alerting can test their contact points right from the contact points page. This feature makes it easier to configure Grafana 8 alerting and gives you the confidence in knowing that your contact points are working as expected before they fire.
Here are the basics:
What are contact points?
Contact points contain configuration for zero or more contact point types (i.e. email, Slack, webhook, etc.) that receive notifications when an alert is firing. A contact point is not limited to just one contact point type and can have multiple contact point types.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.
