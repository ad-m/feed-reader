        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ben Hoyt has published a critical
overview of the Python 3.10 pattern-matching feature.


	As shown above, there are cases where match really
	shines. But they are few and far between, mostly when handling
	syntax trees and writing parsers. A lot of code does have
	if ... elif chains, but these are often either
	plain switch-on-value, where elif works almost as well, or
	the conditions they’re testing are a more complex combination of
	tests that don’t fit into case patterns (unless you use awkward
	case _ if cond clauses, but that’s strictly worse than
	elif).


(Pattern matching has been covered here as
well).]]></summary>

on alpha, after all these years? A slight change of pace ;)]]></summary>

at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the

	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,

What do you do at Grafana Labs?
I am a Senior Technical Writer. My primary focus is improving the open source documentation for the Grafana product. The docs-as-code practice, along with the opportunity to improve community adoption, motivated me to join Grafana Labs. 
What open source projects do you contribute to?
Working at Grafana gave me my first exposure to the open source world. I would love to contribute to other projects in the near future.

Dropped log lines due to out-of-order timestamps can be a thing of the past! Allowing out-of-order writes has been one of the most-requested features for Loki, and we’re happy to announce that in the upcoming v2.4 release, the requirement to have log lines arrive in order by timestamp will be lifted. Simple configuration will allow out-of-order writes for Loki v2.4. If you’re using Grafana Cloud, our fully managed platform integrating metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards, out-of-order writes are already accepted.
The restriction and its effects

Datadog is a powerful product used by many teams, and we hear a lot from customers about how we should further embrace and support this critical data source — which is why we created the Datadog data source plugin a few years ago. Recently, our community and customers have asked us to provide a deeper interoperability with Datadog, offering an experience that is not limited by the Datadog API rate limits.
So today we are introducing a suite of new capabilities in the plugin:
The ability to host Datadog metrics in Grafana Cloud using an easy-to-use Datadog-compliant API

But if you do carry out an update -- such as under Windows -- the performance uplift can be worthwhile if using a game that can benefit from the support.]]></summary>

Over the last few months, we’ve made it even easier to get started with out-of-the-box dashboards and new visualizations in Grafana Cloud. We also introduced capabilities like query caching, a “prettify JSON” option and commands for cortex-tools to make your data, dashboards, and queries more efficient. Finally we’ve added new ways to customize your Grafana Cloud experience with improved reporting, synthetic monitoring and more.

Observability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them
In this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.
Register now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.]]></summary>

ISSUE #559 - 12th September 2021
A few good hindsight design posts this week, both on API design and on data storage cost control. As with lots of decisions, you can apply some patterns too early, but knowing you’ll need to change later if you succeed is useful to remember.
StackHawk sponsors Devops Weekly
============================
Trying to figure out how to keep your APIs secure? You're not the only one. See how DataRobot is automating API security testing with StackHawk.

====
A good post on the early decisions (in this case around data storage) that can lead to cost control discussions later. You can apply this to other systems as well.
