        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined Grafana Labs as a software engineer in October to help build out a team focused on OpenTelemetry, and within a few weeks, I was promptly encouraged to run for a seat on the OpenTelemetry board.
Every year, the OpenTelemetry community holds elections for a few seats on the Governance Committee board, which oversees the project at large. The results of this year’s elections are now available, and I am glad to share that I have been elected to serve on the board!
I’m thankful for every one of the votes I got and I am honored to work with the members of the board. I believe that the results of this election reflect my contributions to the community over the past few years, including code contributions, speaking engagements, blog posts, and supporting users.
It is also a reflection of the commitment Grafana Labs has to investing in OpenTelemetry. I wouldn’t have been a candidate without the company’s support and without the freedom to dedicate official working hours to this endeavor.
Grafana Labs’ interest in OpenTelemetry is not new: We have been supporting OTLP as a possible input protocol for Grafana Tempo since its inception, and our Grafana Agent embeds parts of the OpenTelemetry Collector.
As a member of the board, my goals align with the platform I submitted for the election:
Community: Ensure that OpenTelemetry’s decisions continue to be compatible with the interests of the broader open source observability ecosystem, including users, developers, projects, and vendors.
Diversity: Create new and strengthen existing diversity initiatives, like Outreachy, across OpenTelemetry’s SIGs and projects.
I’m looking forward to collaborating with the members of the board for the next two years!
Are you interested in joining Grafana Labs? Come work with me and other Grafanistas on OpenTelemetry and other parts of the observability ecosystem!]]></summary>

another nine-week development cycle.


	This release may have started out with some -Werror pain, but it
	calmed down fairly quickly and on the whole 5.15 was fair small and
	calm. Let's hope for more of the same - without Werror issues this
	time - for the upcoming merge window.


The code name for this release has been set to "Trick or Treat".

Significant features in this release include:
the realtime
preemption locking code,
descriptorless files for io_uring,
BPF timers,
the removal of mandatory file-locking support,
the ksmbd SMB filesystem server (but see this
article),
printk() indexing,
the process_mrelease() system
call,
The DAMON memory-management optimization
system,
the ntfs3 filesystem implementation,

Current location/time zone: I live in Bristol, U.K., which at time of writing is in the UTC+1 time zone. Bristol has been described as “lively yet laid-back” and “one of the most cosmopolitan centers outside London.” I like it because it has an incredibly high density of independent breweries.
What do you do at Grafana Labs? I work on the systems supporting Grafana Cloud, specifically those systems managing the Grafana instances we run for our customers. We also identify opportunities for improvement that arise when running Graf…]]></summary>

The final projects ranged from a live stocks and crypto monitoring platform (which was named the overall winner and dubbed the Best Pitch) to a feature that allows Grafana users within an organization to share recordings of your favorite dashboards, panels, and interactions. 
The trio known as The Alchemists took home the prize for Best Integration/Plugin. Here’s a look at how their project came together.

ISSUE #564 - 17th October 2021
Seeing all of the tweets from KubeCon this week really made me miss seeing everyone in person. Devops to me has been all about the community, and while that still exists in virtual form, it’s always been one of my favourite things to meet up with, and talk to, people in this community in real life..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.
