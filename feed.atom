of block-layer optimizations that enabled a suitably equipped system to
sustain 3.5 million I/O operations per second (IOPS).  That
optimization work has continued since then, and those 3.5 million IOPS
would be a deeply disappointing result now.  A recent disagreement over the
addition of a new feature has highlighted the potential cost of a heavily
optimized block layer, though; when is a feature deemed important enough to
outweigh the drive for maximum performance?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over at the SAMBA+ blog, the performance of the new ksmbd kernel SMB server and Samba in user space are compared:

ksmbd claims performance improvements on a wide range of benchmarks: the graphs on this page show a doubling of performance on some tests. There was also the notion that an in-kernel server is likely an easier place to support SMB Direct, which uses RDMA to transfer data between systems.

Clearly, those number are impressive, but at the same time recent improvements in Samba's IO performance put this into perspective: by leveraging the new "io_uring" Linux API Samba is able to provide roughly 10x the throughput compared to ksmbd.

Time will tell whether it's better to reside in kernel-space like ksmbd or in user-space like Samba in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the available hardware.


There are two graphs that show some impressive results for Samba.]]></summary>

the process of starting a program on Linux in great detail.



	Well, __libc_start_main calls __libc_init_first,
	who immediately uses secret inside information to find the
	environment variables just after the terminating null of the
	argument vector and then sets a global variable __environ
	which __libc_start_main uses thereafter whenever it needs
	it including when it calls main. After the envp
	is established, then __libc_start_main uses the same trick
	and surprise! Just past the terminating null at the end of the
	envp array, there's another vector, the ELF auxiliary
	vector the loader uses to pass some information to the process. An
	easy way to see what's in there is to set the environment variable
	LD_SHOW_AUXV=1 before running the program.]]></summary>

The Prometheus TSDB has gained experimental support to store and retrieve these new sparse high-resolution histograms. At PromCon 2021, we presented our exciting, fresh-off-the-presses results from the ongoing project. (For a deeper dive into sparse histograms, check out the in-depth design doc that Björn wrote.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined Grafana Labs as a software engineer in October to help build out a team focused on OpenTelemetry, and within a few weeks, I was promptly encouraged to run for a seat on the OpenTelemetry board.
Every year, the OpenTelemetry community holds elections for a few seats on the Governance Committee board, which oversees the project at large. The results of this year’s elections are now available, and I am glad to share that I have been elected to serve on the board!
I’m thankful for every one of the votes I got and I am honored to work with the members of the board. I believe that the results of this election reflect my contributions to the community over the past few years, including code contributions, speaking engagements, blog posts, and supporting users.
It is also a reflection of the commitment Grafana Labs has to investing in OpenTelemetry. I wouldn’t have been a candidate without the company’s support and without the freedom to dedicate official working hours to this endeavor.
Grafana Labs’ interest in OpenTelemetry is not new: We have been supporting OTLP as a possible input protocol for Grafana Tempo since its inception, and our Grafana Agent embeds parts of the OpenTelemetry Collector.
As a member of the board, my goals align with the platform I submitted for the election:
Community: Ensure that OpenTelemetry’s decisions continue to be compatible with the interests of the broader open source observability ecosystem, including users, developers, projects, and vendors.
Diversity: Create new and strengthen existing diversity initiatives, like Outreachy, across OpenTelemetry’s SIGs and projects.
I’m looking forward to collaborating with the members of the board for the next two years!
Are you interested in joining Grafana Labs? Come work with me and other Grafanistas on OpenTelemetry and other parts of the observability ecosystem!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.
