Software Freedom Conservancy is proud to announce that its efforts to
stand up for the rights of FOSS developers have been successful and that
it has been granted almost all of the exemptions that it requested in
the Librarian of Congress' recent rule making, according to the final
rule Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection
Systems for Access Control Technologies, which was published today.
Effective today, the Librarian of Congress ("LoC") granted DMCA
exemptions for installing alternate firmwares on routers and for
investigating copyleft compliance, and the exemption that Software
Freedom Conservancy previously applied for and received on Smart TVs was
also expanded. While our formal request to extend the security research
exemption to include privacy research was not granted, the Register
clarified that privacy research is indeed included in security research.
Our executive director, Karen Sandler, also participated as an
individual in a request to expand the existing exemption for medical
devices which was also successful.]]></summary>

balance the needs of current users of memory with anticipated future needs,
for example.  The kernel must 
also balance the act of reclaiming memory for other uses, which can involve
writing data to permanent storage, with the rate of data that the
underlying storage devices are able to accept.  For years, the
memory-management subsystem has used storage-device congestion as a signal
that it should slow down reclaim.  Unfortunately, that mechanism, which was
a bit questionable from the beginning, has not worked in a long time.  Mel
Gorman is now trying to fix this problem with a
patch set that moves the kernel away from the idea of waiting on congestion.]]></summary>

Prometheus is the industry standard in cloud native metric monitoring with hundreds of thousands of installations, millions of users, and billions in market value.
Speaking as a member of the Prometheus team, we have seen the project become a victim of its own success. While most people may be using Prometheus, not everybody is following the same operating standards. Over the years, we’ve seen again and again that there is a ton of informal knowledge among projects and vendors about who is actually compatible with Prometheus and who might not be, but there is strong reluctance to engage in a public dispute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you running Kubernetes? Are you overwhelmed by the amount of telemetry you are gathering? Are you not yet gathering anything at all? 
Whether you’re running simple or more complex Kubernetes clusters, it’s easy to amass hundreds of gigabytes of logs, metrics, and traces every day. Making sense of it all is where the real challenge begins. 
For some easy solutions, tune into our “Intro to monitoring Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud” webinar on Thursday, Oct. 21 at 9:30 PDT / 12:30 EDT / 16:30 UTC to learn how to parse through all the telemetry of Kubernetes with Grafana Cloud and seamlessly monitor and alert on core Kubernetes cluster metrics using the Grafana Agent.

		
			
		
	


In this introductory session, Éamon Ryan, Senior Operations Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, and Catherine Johnson, Senior Principal Solutions Engineer at Grafana Labs, will break down the basics about Kubernetes and walk through how Grafana Cloud can help visualize all the data on your cluster and give you a better read on the health of your systems. 
The Grafana Labs team will also demo how to correlate between metrics, logs and traces on the fly, and how to use the Kubernetes mixin to access your Grafana dashboards and configure important alerts and recording rules. 
We hope you’ll join us!
Grafana Cloud is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards. We have a generous forever-free tier and plans for every use case. Sign up for free now!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I joined Grafana Labs last year as a software engineer in the Enterprise Plugins team and then moved to the Cloud Data Sources team as an engineering manager this year.
When our first company-wide hackathon was announced in June, I decided to participate for a few reasons. After moving to the manager track, I thought it was a great opportunity to do some coding between meetings. Secondly, while ideas are always encouraged at Grafana Labs, and there are always interesting and challenging projects, it was a nice chance to sit down and focus on something that can be more out of the box and creative. And finally, I wanted to set an example for my team. When it comes to personal development or finding personal projects, I regularly encourage the team to take a break from Business As Usual (BAU)…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What would a totally new search engine architecture look like? Who better than Julien Lemoine, Co-founder & CTO of Algolia, to describe what the future of search will look like. This is the second article in a series. Here's Part 1.

Search engines need to support fast scaling for both Read and Write operations. Rapid scaling is essential in most use cases. For example, adding a vendor in a marketplace generates a spike of indexing operations (Write), and a marketing campaign generates a spike of queries (Read). In most use cases, both Read and Write operations scale but not at the exact same moment. The architecture needs to handle efficiently all these situations as the scaling of Read and Write operations varies over time in most use cases.

Until now, search engines were scaling with Read and Write operations colocated on the same VMs. This scaling method brings drawbacks, such asWrite operations unnecessarily hurting the Read performance and using a significant amount of duplicated CPU at indexing. This article explains those drawbacks and introduces a new way to scale more quickly and efficiently by splitting Read and Write operations.
