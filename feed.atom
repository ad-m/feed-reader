On 2020-12-17, Prometheus Team held a dev summit where they agreed to cover Grafana Agent-like functionality in the official Prometheus project.Â 
On 2021-01-27, I published a proposal for how we could do this by moving Grafana Agent code upstream.Â 
On 2021-05-05, the initial PR to move Grafana Agent code upstream was opened.Â 
On 2021-10-29, that PR was merged into Prometheusâs main branch.Â

	ort does just that: itâs a full-blown rewrite of the merge strategy

	avoiding many of its long-standing performance and correctness
	problems. In a merge containing many renames, ort outperforms
	recursive by 500x. For a series of similar merges (like in a rebase

        <link href="https://lwn.net/Articles/875945/rss"/>
        <updated>2021-11-12T17:49:13.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over on the Google Security blog, Jonathan Metzman announced the release of ClusterFuzzLite, which is "a continuous fuzzing solution that runs as part of CI/CD workflows to find vulnerabilities faster than ever before".   ClusterFuzzLite is a descendant of OSS-Fuzz, which we looked at in 2017.

Large projects including systemd and curl are already using ClusterFuzzLite during code review, with positive results. According to Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, âWhen the human reviewers nod and have approved the code and your static code analyzers and linters can't detect any more issues, fuzzing is what takes you to the next level of code maturity and robustness. OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzzLite help us maintain curl as a quality project, around the clock, every day and every commit.â

[...] To learn more, check out the ClusterFuzzLite documentation. ClusterFuzzLite currently supports GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build and Prow. We built this with CI system extensibility in mind, and adding support for other CI systems is straightforward. Please contact us if youâre interested in contributing support, or have any questions, feedback or feature requests.]]></summary>

The post covers a number of different topics, including the consolidation of web sites at go.dev, releases and their features over the last year, as well as a look to the future:

In February, the Go 1.18 release will expand the new register-based calling convention to non-x86 architectures, bringing dramatic performance improvements with it. It will include the new Go fuzzing support. And it will be the first release to include support for generics.

Generics will be one of our focuses for 2022. The initial release in Go 1.18 is only the beginning. We need to spend time using generics and learning what works and what doesnât, so that we can write best practices and decide what should be added to the standard library and other libraries. We expect that Go 1.19 (expected in August 2022) and later releases will further refine the design and implementation of generics as well as integrating them further into the overall Go experience.]]></summary>
