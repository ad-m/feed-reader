post from Christian Schaller describing a number of the
desktop-oriented improvements that can be expected in the Fedora 35
release.


	And I know some people will wonder why we spent so much time
	working with NVidia around their binary driver, but the reality is
	that NVidia is the market leader, especially in the professional
	Linux workstation space, and there are lot of people who either
	would end up not using Linux or using Linux with X without it,
	including a lot of Red Hat customers and Fedora users. And that is
	what I and my team are here for at the end of the day, to make sure
	Red Hat customers are able to get their job done using their Linux

at the difficulties caused by the OpenSSL 3 transition in the
context of Alpine Linux.


	For distributions, however, the story is different:
	cryptography moved to using Rust, because they wanted to
	leverage all of the static analysis capabilities built into the
	language.  This, too, is a reasonable decision, from a development
	perspective.  From the ecosystem perspective, however, it is
	problematic, as the Rust ecosystem is still rapidly evolving, and
	so we cannot support a single branch of the Rust compiler for an
	entire 2 year lifecycle, which means it exists in community.  Our
	solution, historically, has been to hold cryptography at
	the latest version that did not require Rust to build.  However,
	that version is not compatible with OpenSSL 3, and so it will
	eventually need to be upgraded to a new version which is.  And so,
	since cryptography has to move to community, so does
	paramiko and Ansible.]]></summary>

Linux 5.15 overall has been in good shape for the "-rc1" state except noticing that code compilation workloads were taking longer on multiple Linux 5.15-rc1-running systems than Linux 5.14 or prior. Seeing it across multiple systems and a very real-world regression, it was worth bisecting and looking closer so here are the details.]]></summary>

Dropped log lines due to out-of-order timestamps can be a thing of the past! Allowing out-of-order writes has been one of the most-requested features for Loki, and we’re happy to announce that in the upcoming v2.4 release, the requirement to have log lines arrive in order by timestamp will be lifted.

Datadog is a powerful product used by many teams, and we hear a lot from customers about how we should further embrace and support this critical data source — which is why we created the Datadog data source plugin a few years ago. Recently, our community and customers have asked us to provide a deeper interoperability with Datadog, offering an experience that is not limited by the Datadog API rate limits.
So today we are introducing a suite of new capabilities in the plugin:

is a flexible tool for managing issues via the web or

Roundup,

released in July; it is a maintenance release, but there have been a number

Observability tools give you better insight into application performance in production. Load testing is the other half of the observability puzzle, giving you quality data to test for application performance before going live and highlighting performance issues before it’s too late to fix them
In this webinar, Developer Advocate Nicole van der Hoeven will give an overview of k6, a load testing platform for modern engineering teams. You’ll get a live demo of how to create in minutes a load testing script that is realistic enough to make your test environments more production-like. Then we’ll go over your options for integration with Grafana and Prometheus, so your load test results can be seen wherever your team is already looking. By the end of this webinar, you’ll understand how to use k6 to run thousand-user load tests from different geographical regions on the cloud, and how to use Grafana to make sense of all the results.
Register now for the webinar. You can also find out how Grafana Labs uses k6 internally in this blog post.]]></summary>

ISSUE #559 - 12th September 2021
A few good hindsight design posts this week, both on API design and on data storage cost control. As with lots of decisions, you can apply some patterns too early, but knowing you’ll need to change later if you succeed is useful to remember.

============================
Trying to figure out how to keep your APIs secure? You're not the only one. See how DataRobot is automating API security testing with StackHawk.

====
A good post on the early decisions (in this case around data storage) that can lead to cost control discussions later. You can apply this to other systems as well.

We didn’t stop there. In Grafana 8.1, alongside new additions like the Geomap and Annotations panel, we introduced some new features to the Time series panel as well as two transformations to help make panel configuration more dynamic.

This option enables you to color a line or bar by using the values set in the Thresholds settings or a predefined color scale. As your data crosses the defined threshold(s), the color of the line will change to match. 
Here’s a line chart with the Gradient mod…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce the launch of query caching in Grafana Cloud, which can significantly reduce load times and costs of your most popular Grafana dashboards. 
Now, when the same query is submitted repeatedly, the results will come back from the cache rather than the data source itself. This not only lowers load times for popular dashboards, but will also reduce API costs for your data sources and decrease the likelihood that those APIs will rate-limit or throttle requests. 
Here’s one common scenario in which query caching can have a great impact on organizations. For many of our users, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the busiest days of the year, when dashboards are being viewed by everyone across the org. On these mission-critical days, it’s vital that time is not lost waiting …]]></summary>
